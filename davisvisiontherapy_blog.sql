Gone are overbearing gradients and dozens of shades of grey — bring on a bigger, bolder, more colorful design!</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2856" style="margin-left: 0;margin-right: 0" alt="about-modern-wordpress" src="http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/design.png?resize=623%2C151" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<h3>Modern aesthetic</h3>\n<p>The new WordPress dashboard has a fresh, uncluttered design that embraces clarity and simplicity.</p>\n<h3>Clean typography</h3>\n<p>The Open Sans typeface provides simple, friendly text that is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility. With superior contrast and large, comfortable type, the new design is easy to read and a pleasure to navigate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">WordPress on every device</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2984" alt="responsive" src="http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/responsive.jpg?resize=255%2C255" data-recalc-dims="1" />We all access the internet in different ways. Smartphone, tablet, notebook, desktop — no matter what you use, WordPress will adapt and you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>High definition at high speed</h3>\n<p>WordPress is sharper than ever with new vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By ditching pixels, pages load significantly faster, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Admin color schemes to match your personality</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2954" alt="colors" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/colors.jpg?resize=623%2C339" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>WordPress just got a colorful new update. We’ve included eight new admin color schemes so you can pick the one that suits you best.</p>\n<p>Color schemes can be previewed and changed from your Profile page.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Refined theme management</h2>\n<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2967" alt="themes" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/themes.jpg?resize=360%2C344" data-recalc-dims="1" />The new themes screen lets you survey your themes at a glance. Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class="aligncenter">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789" alt="The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone" src="http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen. Choose a grid or a slider to display featured content on your homepage. Customize your site with three widget areas or change your layout with two page templates.</p>\n<p>With a striking design that does not compromise our trademark simplicity, Twenty Fourteen is our most intrepid default theme yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beginning of a new era</h2>\n<p>This release was led by Matt Mullenweg. This is our second release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. We think it’s been going great.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">on the make/core blog</a>.

Their goal is to make file sharing “<a title="https://cloudup.com/blog/cloudup-automattic" href="https://cloudup.com/blog/cloudup-automattic">simple and beautiful.</a>” Not having any experience with <a title="https://www.dropbox.com/" href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, Cloudup was amazingly easy to set up and start using. In the past, I used FTP to upload images I wanted to share to a folder I had access to. This was a cumbersome approach to file sharing but it worked.</p>\n<h3>Installation Of The Cloudup App</h3>\n<p>Cloudup supports Mac and Windows for the desktop while iOS and Android apps are available for mobile devices. The installer is 28MB in size which makes for a quick download. Once installed, you&#8217;ll need to link the app to your Cloudup account. The service is still invite only but if you visit <a title="https://cloudup.com/signup/manual?code=matt" href="https://cloudup.com/signup/manual?code=matt">this invitation link</a>, you&#8217;ll gain access immediately.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CloudupApp.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13952]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13981" alt="Cloudup After Account Has Been Linked" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CloudupApp.jpg" width="265" height="238" /></a></p>\n<p>After the account has been linked, you can access the dashboard and preferences by clicking on the small Cloudup icon located within the Taskbar.</p>\n<h3>Using Cloudup</h3>\n<p>There are two primary ways to upload content. You can either drag files to the taskbar icon or click on the icon, then select <strong>Upload/Browse</strong>. When a file is uploaded, the app will automatically open the file in a new browser window and copy the unique URL to the clipboard for easy sharing. From within this browser window, you can choose whether the image is public or private, edit the image title, or add a password.</p>\n<div id="attachment_13982" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CloudupEditing.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13952]"><img class="size-large wp-image-13982" alt="Cloudup Editor After Uploading A File" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CloudupEditing-500x494.jpg" width="500" height="494" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cloudup Editor After Uploading A File</p></div>\n<p>In its simplest form, it only takes two steps to share a file. The first is to upload it. The second is to paste the URL to whomever you want to have access to the file. Also, users don&#8217;t have to wait until the entire file is uploaded before sharing the URL.</p>\n<h3>Free Accounts Limited To 1,000 Items</h3>\n<div id="attachment_13983" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CloudupFreeTier.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13952]"><img class="size-large wp-image-13983" alt="Cloudup Free Users Limited To 1,000 Items" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CloudupFreeTier-500x341.jpg" width="500" height="341" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cloudup Free Users Limited To 1,000 Items</p></div>\n<p>New users are automatically placed into the free tier. This tier is the only one available at the moment and gives users 1,000 items. According to Matt Mullenweg in a <a title="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/25/automattic-acquires-file-sharing-service-cloudup-to-build-faster-media-library-and-enable-co-editing/" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/25/automattic-acquires-file-sharing-service-cloudup-to-build-faster-media-library-and-enable-co-editing/">Techcrunch article covering the acquisition</a>, there are no plans to monetize the service.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We think Cloudup is something intrinsically useful to have in the world, and Automattic’s core businesses in WordPress.com, VIP, VaultPress, and Akismet are doing more than well enough for us as a company.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Each item has a maximum size limit of 200MB. Depending on what you&#8217;re streaming, this is equal to 200GB of free space. This amount is incredibly generous.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Media Library Improvements</h3>\n<p>One of the most exciting things to come out of the <a title="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/cloudup-joins-the-automattic-family/" href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/cloudup-joins-the-automattic-family/">acquisition announcement</a> was the fact that the WordPress media library would be improved by leaps and bounds thanks to Cloudup&#8217;s technology. One of the major improvements the team would be focusing on is collaborative editing. Similar to how Google docs functions, two authors would be able to work together on a single blog post at the same time using the visual editor.</p>\n<h3>First WordPress.com Then Jetpack</h3>\n<p>Users of WordPress.com will be the first to reap the benefits of any WordPress media library improvements. However, thanks to Jetpack, self-hosted WordPress users won&#8217;t be far behind. If you don&#8217;t use Jetpack, Cloudup can still be used by multiple devices without requiring WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Will Cloudup Replace The WordPress Media Library?</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard for me to picture WordPress without the media library we&#8217;ve used for years. Replacing the media library on WordPress.com with Cloudup makes a lot of sense but I wonder how that change would translate to the self hosted version of WordPress. I asked Matt Mullenweg if Cloudup is something he can see replacing the WordPress media library or would there always be a need to keep things local? His response: &#8220;<em>I could see it replacing it</em>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>What it means to replace the library and how it would work is still unknown. However, when I asked WPTavern Twitter followers what they thought about the idea of replacing the library with something hosted in the cloud, here are a few of their responses:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/wptavern">@wptavern</a> Do not want. Own your data = it''s all on *your* server, not someone else''s.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Kim Parsell (@kimparsell) <a href="https://twitter.com/kimparsell/statuses/419265973275742209">January 4, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/wptavern">@wptavern</a> sounds great especially if you ever need to move/migrate site</p>\n<p>&mdash; Forge (@djforge) <a href="https://twitter.com/djforge/statuses/419264044298940416">January 4, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/wptavern">@wptavern</a> Isn''t this essentially a simple CDN? OK as an option/plugin, but not default.</p>\n<p>&mdash; TJ List (@TJList) <a href="https://twitter.com/TJList/statuses/419266157263077377">January 4, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Matt has been a vocal supporter of the idea to <em>own your own data</em>. It&#8217;s one of the many reasons so many people use WordPress so I doubt any media library replacement would go against that ethos.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Cloudup is awesome. It&#8217;s the simplest way to share files I&#8217;ve come across. It&#8217;s also lightning fast.

Most allow archives to be generated via short code on a page while others are simply widgets with different configuration options. Some of the plugins I tested displayed every post ever published which not only inundated visitors, but was a bad use of resources on the server. I eventually found a plugin that had what I was looking for but since installing it, I&#8217;ve been faced with a conundrum.</p>\n<h3>A Simple Way To Display Archives With Compact Archives Plugin</h3>\n<p>I initially wanted to create an archive page so that all of our previous content would be easy to find. To me, WPTavern is a continuously updated archive of WordPress information. Making it easy to find all of the previous knowledge that&#8217;s been published within the past six years is important, especially since it&#8217;s all tied to one specific subject. For displaying the archive, I settled on the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/compact-archives/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/compact-archives/">Compact Archives</a> plugin by Syed Balkhi and Noumaan Yaqoob. I like this plugin because it provides a few different ways via shortcode to display the entire archive of posts. The display is not pretty and doesn&#8217;t include images but then again, the main goal is to make it easy to browse the history of WordPress Tavern.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CompactArchivesOnWPTavern.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13958]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13963" alt="Compact Archive Plugin On WPTavern" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CompactArchivesOnWPTavern-500x193.jpg" width="500" height="193" /></a></p>\n<h3>Search Box or Dedicated Archive Page</h3>\n<p>Once I completed <a title="http://wptavern.com/archives" href="http://wptavern.com/archives">the archive page</a>, I questioned whether or not the work was all for nothing. If you think about it, the search function of WordPress should be able to handle finding previously published content. As long as the search functionality provided relevant results, it would be the only form of archive retrieval needed. I decided to browse around to see how other large WordPress centric sites are archiving their content. Most of them don&#8217;t contain a dedicated archive page and handle everything through their search box.</p>\n<h3>What Would You Do?</h3>\n<p>So this is the conundrum I&#8217;m in, whether to create a dedicated archive page or just have visitors use the search box. I could use both methods but then they become a another page and plugin that needs to be maintained. There are two questions I have. The first is what would you do? The second, how do you archive a WordPress powered site with years of posts?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 22:30:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"WPTavern: WP Caregiver: 30+ WordPress Tweaks in 1 Convenient Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=13960";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wptavern.com/wp-caregiver-30-wordpress-tweaks-in-1-convenient-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3547:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/onoff.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13960]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/onoff.jpg" alt="onoff" width="961" height="291" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13972" /></a><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-caregiver/" target="_blank">WP Caregiver</a> is a hidden gem of a plugin that arrived in the WordPress repository nearly six months ago. The plugin was recently featured on <a href="http://tidyrepo.com/" target="_blank">Tidy Repo</a>, a site dedicated to testing and curating WordPress plugins. Surprisingly, it has only received a handful of downloads, though it has the potential to replace multiple plugins that you may already have in place to handle small WordPress tweaks.</p>\n<p>WP Caregiver is essentially a long list of light switches for core WordPress features and functions. It provides an organized way to turn these on or off at will and is separated into three tabbed categories: Frontend Features, Backend Features and System Information.</p>\n<h4>System Information</h4>\n<p>System Information lets you quickly view your server time, memory usage and SQL queries. It also gives you a quick and easy way to delete all of your post revisions and calculate the disc usage for your site.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/systeminformation.gif" rel="prettyphoto[13960]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/systeminformation.gif" alt="systeminformation" width="771" height="297" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13961" /></a></p>\n<h4>Frontend Features</h4>\n<p>The Frontend tweaks include the ability to easily remove a bunch of extras that many WordPress users don&#8217;t use, such as post relational links, website URL field in the comment form, the admin bar, and more. This screen also contains the ability to quickly enable the Open Graph tags generator. One really useful feature is the option to easily enable &#8220;Quick Maintenance Mode&#8221; with a checkbox. No need to install a separate plugin for creating a maintenance page. </p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frontend.gif" rel="prettyphoto[13960]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frontend.gif" alt="frontend" width="771" height="598" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13964" /></a></p>\n<h4>Backend Features</h4>\n<p>Backend tweaks include the ability to turn off update notifications, hide login error messages, enable excerpt field for pages, enable TinyMCE Editor for excerpt, enable categories for pages and many more handy little changes. The ability to customize the WordPress mail name and address from this screen is a convenient little addition.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/backend.gif" rel="prettyphoto[13960]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/backend.gif" alt="backend" width="771" height="642" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13965" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress was made to be customized.

However, there are certain situations where using a PNG might be preferable, such as when you need lossless compression of larger images or want to maintain alpha transparency. PNGs can also handle more color than JPGs and are sometimes a better choice for using with highly colorful, complex images.</p>\n<p>Although WordPress has built in compression for JPG images, there is nothing in the core to handle PNG compression. That&#8217;s where the <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a> web service comes in handy for compressing PNG images. It provides advanced lossy compression for PNG images that preserves full alpha transparency and is virtually invisible.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/panda.png" rel="prettyphoto[13935]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/panda.png" alt="panda" width="1341" height="531" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13941" /></a></p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s very difficult to see with the naked eye, TinyPNG provides more than 70% reduction in file size here. It uses a technique called “quantisation” that combines similar colors and converts the file to a much smaller 8-bit indexed image. The files produced by the service are supported everywhere, including all major browsers, even as far back as IE 6, and on mobile devices.</p>\n<h3>Use TinyPNG with WordPress to Automatically Compress PNG Files</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/compress-png-for-wp/" target="_blank">Compress PNG for WP</a> is a new plugin created by the folks at <a href="http://geckodesigns.com/" target="_blank">Gecko Designs</a>. It uses the <a href="https://tinypng.com/developers/reference" target="_blank">TinyPNG API</a> to hook up your server to the service and compress images on the fly within WordPress with the same results as using the web service.</p>\n<p>The plugin worked smoothly in my tests. Once installed, you will be required to paste your free TinyPNG API key into the options at <strong>Settings >> Media</strong>. By default the plugin will automatically shrink all uploaded PNG files, but you can disable this feature in the options.</p>\n<p>Newly uploaded PNG files will show the original size, the compressed size and the percentage of savings with the new file size.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pngcompress.png" rel="prettyphoto[13935]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pngcompress.png" alt="pngcompress" width="1800" height="458" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13936" /></a></p>\n<p>Your API key will be monitored for how much you use the service and is limited to 500 conversions per month. The free subscription to TinyPNG is more than adequate for the casual blogger who uploads PNGs fairly infrequently. If you need more than 500 conversions per month for a PNG image heavy site, you might consider purchasing a <a href="https://tinypng.com/subscription" target="_blank">TinyPNG subscription</a>. </p>\n<h3>Benefits of Compressing PNG Images</h3>\n<p>The number one reason to use a plugin to compress PNG images is to speed up your site. Smaller image file sizes will help your site to load more quickly for visitors, creating a better browsing experience. Performance is key to keeping customers happy and faster page load times can lead to more conversions. Compressing PNG files can also significantly reduce your bandwidth usage and may even speed up the time it takes to backup your website. If you make frequent use of PNGs on your site, the free <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/compress-png-for-wp/" target="_blank">Compress PNG for WP</a> plugin can give you a solid boost in performance.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 17:52:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"WordPress.tv: Jake Goldman: 10 Interview Questions I Ask Every Developer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=28209";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wordpress.tv/2014/01/03/jake-goldman-10-interview-questions-i-ask-every-developer/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:693:"<div id="v-9l5oW6P4-1" class="video-player">\n</div><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/28209/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/28209/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=28209&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/01/03/jake-goldman-10-interview-questions-i-ask-every-developer/"><img alt="Jake Goldman: 10 Interview Questions I Ask Every Developer" src="http://videos.videopress.com/9l5oW6P4/video-cc2cda8218_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 17:18:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.9.1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=176342";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://buddypress.org/2014/01/buddypress-1-9-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1008:"<p>BuddyPress 1.9.1 is now available.

Back in the day, self-publishing was considered to be on par with vanity publishing, the dead end route whereby authors pay to have their works published.</p>\n<p>The dawn of the digital era and the proliferation of electronic reading devices has changed everything. Publishing houses are actually starting to look to self-publishers for works and talent compatible with their interests.</p>\n<p>Though self-publishing seems to be the way of the future, it&#8217;s really nothing new. You might be surprised to learn that many of the titans of literary history were self-published at some point in their careers, including the likes of William Blake, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Lord Byron, Benjamin Franklin, Ernest Hemingway, Leo Tolstoy, Mark Twain and many more.

The anti-British sentiment in the paper eventually led to the Crown Post rejecting its delivery throughout the colonies. This prompted Franklin, in cooperation with his partner William Goddard, to establish an alternative mail system, the <a href="http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a1f_wgoddard.html" target="_blank">Constitutional Post</a>, which later became the US Post Office.</p>\n<p>I see many corollaries with modern journalism today. Breaking news and objective viewpoints often come from the blogosphere and not the corporate news desks, where the flow of information can often be corrupted by sponsors and &#8220;good ol&#8217; boy&#8221; relationships. Many modern journalists use WordPress to publish their findings and expose abuses of power without being worried about stepping on corporate toes.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re circulating a periodic publication or writing a book, WordPress provides an easy way to organize and structure your content while it&#8217;s in process. Posts can be kept private while you&#8217;re working on finishing the book. Alternatively, you can release installments of your work to the public by publishing them on your WordPress site. This option gives you the benefit of community feedback during the process of writing your book. Whatever process you choose to enhance your workflow is up to you. WordPress offers the flexibility and tools for any approach and provides several advantages over traditional publishing houses.</p>\n<h5>Advantages to Publishing with WordPress</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Book in process is stored on your server: Access your content from anywhere in the world</li>\n<li>Pre-publish on your WordPress site or keep your posts private</li>\n<li>Full creative and editorial control over your work</li>\n<li>Time to get your book to the market is much faster</li>\n<li>Print on demand</li>\n<li>Full control of pricing and distribution</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Options for Self-Publishing With WordPress</h3>\n<p>There are several plugins available that make it easy to publish WordPress content in print and digital formats. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of the front-runners:</p>\n<h4>Anthologize</h4>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/anthologize/" target="_blank">Anthologize</a> is a free, open source WordPress plugin that helps you to outline, order and edit your work to prepare it for publication. You can create content directly within Anthologize or use it to grab posts that you&#8217;ve already written. You also have the option of pulling in a feed from an external site for inclusion in your publication. From there you can easily arrange all of your content via drag-and-drop and then export it into one volume. Anthologize supports several ebook formats, including PDF, EPUB and TEI.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/anthologize.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13908]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/anthologize.jpg" alt="anthologize" width="931" height="650" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13910" /></a></p>\n<p>Anthologize is not just for arranging book chapters. It also makes it easy to create any kind of anthology. You can use it to organize research for academic journal submissions, publish collections of student work, create hard copies of your blog or diary for personal records or to arrange some of your best blogs for printing.</p>\n<h4>BookPress Client</h4>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bookpress-client/" target="_blank">BookPress Client</a> is another free plugin that allows you to organize your posts into an eBook. The plugin interfaces with the BookPress content-converting server to bind your book into ePub and Kindle mobi formats.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bookpress.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13908]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bookpress.jpg" alt="bookpress" width="422" height="238" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13911" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin creates the new posts using a custom post type so that your book posts won&#8217;t show up with the normal blog posts on your site. You can also create multiple books from one WordPress site so that you don&#8217;t have to set up a new site for each book. BookPress Client also includes the ability to set the cover image to be shown for your book in the Kindle store or other stores. Best of all, the <a href="http://bookpress.me/" target="_blank">BookPress</a> content conversion service is totally free.</p>\n<h4>PressBooks</h4>\n<p><a href="http://pressbooks.com/download" target="_blank">PressBooks</a> is a GPL-licensed plugin that is best when used with a fresh installation of WordPress multisite. It transforms your WordPress setup into a network that is centered around book creation. You can create and edit multiple books where each site on the network is devoted to one book. PressBooks can export your work to PDF (for print-on-demand), Mobi (for Kindle), and EPUB (for Apple iBooks, Nook, Kobo and other ereaders).</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pressbooks.png" rel="prettyphoto[13908]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pressbooks.png" alt="pressbooks" width="1289" height="1001" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13912" /></a></p>\n<p>The open source <a href="http://pressbooks.com/pressbooks-open-source-plugin" target="_blank">PressBooks</a> plugin essentially creates your own hosted version of <a href="http://pressbooks.com/" target="_blank">PressBooks.com</a>, so you may want to try that first before setting up your own instance. This isn&#8217;t a plugin that you would mix in with your regular WordPress site. It&#8217;s meant to be used only for book creation, due to the significant changes that it makes to customize the admin and presentation layer for books and structured documents.</p>\n<h4>Convert a WordPress.com Blog to a Book</h4>\n<p>If you want to create a book using your content from a WordPress.com blog, there are several services available for building your book. One popular choice is <a href="http://www.blurb.com/blog-book" target="_blank">Blurb</a>, a platform for making, printing and publishing independent books. The process involves importing your content from WordPress.com and then designing page layouts and editing using the BookSmart software to prepare your book for publishing.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blurb.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13908]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blurb.jpg" alt="blurb" width="600" height="200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13914" /></a></p>\n<p>Other services that work with WordPress.com include <a href="http://www.fastpencil.com/" target="_blank">FastPencil</a> and <a href="http://blog2print.sharedbook.com/blogworld/printmyblog/index.html" target="_blank">Blog2Print</a>, each with a similar process to Blurb and services to help you sell books and ebooks on Amazon, Apple, Barnes and Noble, Ingram, Kindle, Nook and other stores. </p>\n<h3>Create a Book From an RSS Feed</h3>\n<p>In order to create a book from an RSS feed the content will have to be public before publishing it. If you&#8217;re comfortable with that, you can use a service like <a href="http://www.zinepal.com/" target="_blank">zinepal</a> or <a href="http://www.bloxp.com/" target="_blank">bloxp</a> to turn your blog into an ebook. <a href="http://www.zinepal.com/how" target="_blank">Zinepal</a> has a free option creating the Kindle, Mobipocket or ePub file and then formatting the book. Additional options are available with <a href="http://www.zinepal.com/pro" target="_blank">Pro</a> option. </p>\n<p><a href="http://www.bloxp.com/" target="_blank">Bloxp</a> is an entirely free option for creating an eBook from your RSS feed, although it is limited to 250 blog posts. Once it crawls your site, Bloxp cleans its contents to create a well-formatted ebook. This one doesn&#8217;t come with a lot of extra options &#8211; it&#8217;s just the basics for converting your content into an ePub or Mobi file, readable in most ebook readers.</p>\n<h3>Distribution and Promotion</h3>\n<p>There are many services that you can use to build your book, but doing so in a vacuum is not recommended. You might consider getting a professional editor to provide a copy editing service for your book before sending it out into the world. Once it&#8217;s been polished up and prepared for sale, you&#8217;ll need to select an avenue for distribution. </p>\n<p>Selling your book through a distributor is one way to get it out to the public. However, the most profitable way to sell your book is by distributing it on your own website. This is another aspect that WordPress can easily handle. If you&#8217;re just selling a book (or multiple books), you don&#8217;t even need a full e-commerce set-up. At the most basic level, you could simply paste a PayPal button code on your site to sell your book. Alternatively, you could use a free plugin such as <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, which is entirely devoted to selling digital files, to provide a smoother checkout experience for your book customers. </p>\n<p>Using WordPress to handle distribution opens up many other avenues for promotion and capturing leads generated by the book buzz. You can use WordPress to blog about the book, create a community around your work and provide a way for people to sign up for your newsletter to stay in touch. With a little bit of strategy, you can build an entire business around your book.</p>\n<p>Self-publishing is at the core of the WordPress mission to democratize publishing. With a few additional plugins the platform can handle every aspect of self-publishing from start to finish, whether you&#8217;re sending your book out to the many electronic readers around the world or formatting it to be printed. If publishing a book is on your list of goals for 2014, WordPress has all the tools you need to create, publish and promote your book. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Jan 2014 20:57:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"BuddyPress: Welcoming Mathieu Viet to the BuddyPress core team";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=176300";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://buddypress.org/2014/01/welcoming-mathieu-viet-to-the-buddypress-core-team/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:865:"<p><img src="http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/afa810b8454a58b943fa79a0e34710a8?s=200" /> We&#8217;re excited to start 2014 on a happy note: Mathieu Viet, better known online as <a href="http://buddypress.org/community/members/imath/">imath</a>, is joining the BuddyPress core team.

The <a title="http://wptavern.com/get-more-admin-color-schemes-for-wordpress-3-8" href="http://wptavern.com/get-more-admin-color-schemes-for-wordpress-3-8">Admin Color Schemes plugin</a> provides an additional 8 color schemes to choose from. All of these choices in colors are a great thing for users but there is one problem. Plugins that use images for custom top-level menu icons disrupt the consistency of the WordPress backend.</p>\n<h3>Using Dashicons</h3>\n<p><a title="http://melchoyce.github.io/dashicons/" href="http://melchoyce.github.io/dashicons/">Dashicons</a> were added to the core of WordPress with the release of 3.8. Dashicons are what&#8217;s known as an icon font. The icons are vector based so they can be as large or small as you want without losing quality. Plugin authors can use CSS, HTML, or a Glyph for use within Photoshop to display an icon.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DashIcons.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13867]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8610" alt="Dashicons" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DashIcons.jpg" width="462" height="268" /></a></p>\n<p>Plugin authors are encouraged to look at the variety of Dashicons available to see if one matches the functionality provided by the plugin. For example, a portfolio plugin can use the portfolio Dashicon. My initial concern with using Dashicons is that two different plugins could end up using the same one. When I asked around to see what other people thought, the most common response was that most sites don&#8217;t contain two activated plugins with similar functionality.</p>\n<h3>Using An SVG Icon</h3>\n<p>If plugins authors want to use a custom icon, they can use an SVG image. Similar to Dashicons, SVG images can scale large or small without losing quality. WordPress has JavaScript within the core so that SVG icons will automatically blend in with any color scheme.</p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s A Simple But Important Fix</h3>\n<p>Back in March of 2013, <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/05/30/the-mp6-team-has-been-working-on-recommendations/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/05/30/the-mp6-team-has-been-working-on-recommendations/">Matt Thomas outlined various methods</a> that plugin authors could use to add top-level menu icons that would fit in with MP6. He explained the pros and cons of each method and at the end of post, suggests the best method to use. Whichever method plugin authors choose, I ask them to make the simple change to their top-level menu icons so that they become a natural part of the WordPress backend.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Jan 2014 14:00:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Repository Now Rejects Commits With PHP Errors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=13668";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-repository-now-rejects-commits-with-php-errors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3050:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/blocked.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13668]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/blocked.jpg" alt="blocked" width="900" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13859" /></a></p>\n<p>In case you missed it over the holidays, an important <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2013/12/22/notice-svn-will-reject-php-with-errors/" target="_blank">notice</a> was issued to WordPress.org plugin developers. The WordPress Plugin Repository will no longer allow developers to commit files with PHP syntax errors in them. Mika Epstein, one of the developers who helps to review incoming plugins, posted an example of what the kick-back error notice will look like:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Error: Commit failed (details follow):<br />\nError: Commit blocked by pre-commit hook (exit code 1) with output:<br />\nError: PHP Parse error: syntax error, unexpected end of file in &#8211; on line 1234<br />\nError:<br />\nError: ***********************************<br />\nError: PHP error in: really-cool/tags/1.0/really-cool.php:<br />\nError: Errors parsing really-cool/tags/1.0/really-cool.php<br />\nError: ***********************************<br />\nError: This error was generated by a custom hook script on the Subversion server.<br />\nError: Please contact your server administrator for help with resolving this issue.<br />\nCompleted!:</p></blockquote>\n<p>As you can see here, if your commit is blocked, you&#8217;ll be notified of the file and line containing the error.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the script performs a PHP 5.4 syntax check. In the comments on the notice, Andrew Nacin warns, &#8220;Please be careful if you are using 5.3 or 5.4-specific language features, like namespaces, closures, short array or ternary syntaxes, etc. These will break sites running PHP 5.2 (which is a majority of sites).&#8221; </p>\n<h3>Reasons for Rejecting Commits With PHP Errors</h3>\n<p>This new policy makes a lot of sense, not only for plugin developers but also for the millions of people who install these extensions and expect them to work. Epstein says, &#8220;Such an error would make the plugin fail when it tried to load the file anyway, so think of this as a ‘for your own protection’ kind of thing.&#8221; If somehow the errors were missed during testing, the script in place on the Subversion server is like a second checkpoint to help developers commit error free files.</p>\n<p>Over time the plugin repository should improve for users as a result of having this policy in place. All new plugins and newly committed files will be free from PHP syntax errors. That means fewer plugin failures out in the wild. When hunting through the repo for a WordPress plugin to perform a specific function, it&#8217;s very disappointing to install the plugin only to find that there are errors that prevent it from working at all. Eventually, this new policy will help create a better experience for users installing plugins from the official WordPress.org repository.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Jan 2014 13:01:30

you&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://alexking.org/projects/social">Social</a> for a while like I have, you might also be seeing broken images in the comments area of your old posts. I did a little digging into this and discovered that this is related to how Twitter handles user avatars.</p>\n<p>When Twitter returns a user object, they include the URL of the user&#8217;s avatar. But that URL isn&#8217;t a reliable URL (like Facebook provides). Instead it&#8217;s a URL to a file location on a CDN. Over time these URLs change, likely relating to users changing their avatars.</p>\n<p>Social grabs the provided user avatar URL when creating comments from Twitter replies, retweets, or for comments by people who log in with Twitter and faithfully sticks it in for appropriate comments &#8211; even when that URL has stopped working.</p>\n<p>Since Twitter doesn&#8217;t provide a reliable URL that we can use over time, I ended up <a href="https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-social-twitter-avatar-update">creating a little plugin</a> that asks Twitter for the <em>current</em> user avatar for each Twitter account related to Social comment activity and updates the comments with the new image URLs accordingly.</p>\n<p>This plugin runs a one-time action, asking Twitter for user information 100 users at a time and updating your comments at that time. So you&#8217;ll need to run it every so often to keep things looking and working properly. Since it is a fairly intensive action, I didn&#8217;t think putting it on a CRON was a good idea.</p>\n<p>When you activate the plugin you&#8217;ll see a &#8220;Run&#8221; link in it&#8217;s section on the Plugins page. Click that and it will hit Twitter and do its thing.</p>\n<p><img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/social-twitter-avatar-fix-510x68.png" alt="Social Twitter Avatar Fix" width="480" height="64" class="alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-19032" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worked well for my site but that&#8217;s about the extent if the testing that&#8217;s been done with it. Normal caveats like &#8220;make sure you have backups&#8221; apply.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it &#8211; I hope you&#8217;ll find this useful if you&#8217;re using Social with your WordPress site.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-social-twitter-avatar-update">Download, fork and contribute on GitHub.</a></p>\n<p class="threads-post-notice">This post is part of the project: <a href="http://alexking.org/project/social">Social</a>.

Konstantin shares some of the lessons learned throughout its development and explains what direction TwentyFifteen may take.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it would be great if we could combine the two approaches, start from scratch and use an existing theme, for Twenty Fifteen. Let’s create a theme design from scratch, much like Twenty Twelve and Twenty Thirteen, and have it be based on _s, as the pre-existing theme.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, a cool idea sprang from his post. A <a title="http://www.csszengarden.com/" href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> like website but for WordPress themes. CSS Zen Garden showcases what&#8217;s possible with just CSS. The HTML structure stays the same, while CSS provides all of the visual elements. The idea proposed for WordPress is to use a simple theme like <a title="http://underscores.me/" href="http://underscores.me/">_s</a> and apply changes only through the style.css file.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But most importantly: Let changes only be in style.css. That’s it! No additional functionality or bloat. If anything, we take unneeded code out. This doesn’t mean it can’t look good. It doesn’t mean it will be less awesome than its predecessors. CSS is a powerful tool, if in the right hands.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Not A New Idea</h3>\n<p>In 2005, Alex King hosted a <a title="http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition" href="http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition">WordPress theme competition</a> for WordPress 1.5. Entries were composed of changes to the style.css file for the WordPress 1.2 template and 1.5 Classic Theme. The WordPress theme landscape was much different during this time and through competitions like Alex King&#8217;s, WordPress users instantly had a larger variety of themes to choose from.</p>\n<p>As an aside, <a title="http://konstantin.obenland.it/2013/12/19/twenty-fifteen/comment-page-1/#comment-33" href="http://konstantin.obenland.it/2013/12/19/twenty-fifteen/comment-page-1/#comment-33">this comment by Lance Willett</a> provides some food for thought. Basically, instead of themes becoming more complex, perhaps the core of WordPress needs to have more features and improvements so code heavy items are taken out of the theme. Overall, I think a CSS Zen Garden like website for WordPress default themes is an excellent idea.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 17:31:29

investigate pretty much every new publishing system that comes out. I&#8217;m eager to see what features they think are important, and see what might spark new ideas for my own site. I got my invite to try <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> a short time ago. I put up a test post, and was a shocked by what I saw in the footer.</p>\n<p><img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ghost-copyright-510x307.png" alt="Ghost Copyright" width="480" height="288" class="alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-18997" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve circled the footer area, which includes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All content copyright Ghost &copy; 2013 &middot; All rights reserved.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My reaction upon seeing this? <em>Whoah &#8211; &#8220;Copyright Ghost&#8221;? I don&#8217;t think so&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>I did a little poking around and found <a href="https://ghost.org/about/terms/">Ghost&#8217;s Terms of Service</a>, which are derived from the <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tos/">WordPress.com TOS</a> and are released under a Creative Common 3.0 license. That was more like what I expected and didn&#8217;t seem to jive with what I was seeing in the footer.</p>\n<p>So I did a little more searching. Pretty soon I found this:</p>\n<p><img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ghost-template-510x68.png" alt="Template File" width="480" height="64" class="alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-19000" /></p>\n<p>In the search results, I could see that the line that was bothering me is actually a pretty reasonable bit of template language:</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>All content copyright {{@blog.title}} &copy; 2013 [&hellip;]</code></p></blockquote>\n<p>This was a simple matter of defaults causing accidental messaging. See when you create a blog on Ghost, the default name of the blog is &#8220;Ghost&#8221;. Then the footer is outputting the blog name (Ghost) as the copyright holder.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> If I had taken the time to set my blog name to &#8220;Alex King&#8221;, then the footer message would have read &#8220;copyright Alex King&#8221;. This is a case of several things coming together to say something they didn&#8217;t mean.</p>\n<p>Be careful with your defaults! Your messaging is important and if you&#8217;re not careful it can say something you didn&#8217;t intend.</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\nI&#8217;m not a lawyer, but I believe this really isn&#8217;t an accurate copyright statement.

And we&#8217;re already fast approaching our 115-billionth.</p>\n<p>The levels of spam we&#8217;re seeing and catching have increased dramatically over the past year. In fact, when compared with 2012 numbers (as seen in <a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2012/12/21/a-spammy-year-in-review/">last year&#8217;s post</a>), each month in 2013 experienced an average year-over-year increase of <strong>more than 70%</strong>, as the following chart shows:</p>\n<p><a href="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/akismet-2013-spam-totals.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1121 aligncenter" alt="Akismet 2013 Spam Totals - Month by Month" src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/akismet-2013-spam-totals.png?w=600&h=375" width="600" height="375" /></a></p>\n<p>On average, we are currently catching around <strong>200 million</strong> spam comments every day, which is about <strong>80 million more</strong> than our daily average this time last year. That&#8217;s over <strong>8,000,000 per hour</strong>, or over <strong>2,000 per second</strong>. For the year, we averaged over <strong>120 million </strong>spam comments per day &#8211; a year-over-year jump of over 50 million. On December 21, we set a new record zapping <strong>245 million</strong> spam comments in just 24 hours.</p>\n<p>While spam themes and schemes are always changing, knockoff fashion-goods spam (which we talked about in last year&#8217;s post) dominated 2013. Even more troubling is the rising trend of these spammers using hacked sites to deliver payloads. You may have seen these before, where links point to individual pages that include an extension (like &#8220;.asp&#8221;). We suspect that <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2013/12/the-new-spammer-panic">disenchanted SEO spammers</a> are using this strategy in response to new policies by Google. Instead of simply posting comments with links to their own sites, they&#8217;ve moved to hacking vulnerable sites and launching buffer pages. Since the launch of Google&#8217;s Penguin 2.1 back in October, we have actually seen a significant increase in daily spam averages.</p>\n<p>Other themes of comment spam have certainly developed and intensified over the last 12 months (spell casters, anyone?), but these are merely blips on the radar compared to the knockoff-fashion variety. Here are some recent examples of sites that Akismet intercepted:</p>\n\n<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2013/12/27/2013-in-review/oakley-knockoff-spam-site/"><img width="150" height="101" src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/oakley-knockoff-spam-site.png?w=150&h=101" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Oakley Knockoff Spam" /></a>\n<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2013/12/27/2013-in-review/ugg-knockoff-spam-site/"><img width="150" height="86" src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/ugg-knockoff-spam-site.png?w=150&h=86" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Ugg Knockoff Spam" /></a>\n<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2013/12/27/2013-in-review/nfl-jerseys-knockoff-spam-site/"><img width="150" height="96" src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/nfl-jerseys-knockoff-spam-site.png?w=150&h=96" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="NFL Jersey Knockoff Spam" /></a>\n\n<p>Beyond our usual spam fighting activities, we have also started reaching out to other UGC services to see where, based on our vast pool of spam data, we can help in identifying spam troubling their own communities. We hope to expand that initiative in the coming year, and include hosts in the conversation as well. In 2014 you can also expect more educational anti-spam projects (including webinars), more frequent and insightful blog content, enhanced support documentation, and an increase in developer-friendly initiatives.

week on the Tavern we&#8217;ve been following the trend of new plugins popping up for customizing admin color schemes. Since WordPress 3.8 was released, developers have been having fun creating tools that give WordPress users more options beyond the eight default schemes. Yesterday we featured the <a href="http://wptavern.com/create-custom-admin-color-schemes-directly-within-wordpress" target="_blank">HS Custom Admin Theme</a> plugin as one of the first plugins to take a stab at it, but the developer seems to have pulled it from the repo. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, Helen Hou-Sandi, in collaboration with Mark Jaquith, released a new plugin today called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemer/" target="_blank">Admin Color Schemer</a> that gives you the ability to create and preview color schemes within the WordPress admin. This is by far the smoothest implementation of this feature that I&#8217;ve seen to date.</p>\n<p>After you install the plugin, you&#8217;ll find a new &#8220;Admin Colors&#8221; menu under <strong>Tools</strong>. This seems a little difficult to find, but Helen <a href="https://github.com/helenhousandi/admin-color-schemer/issues/12" target="_blank">plans to add an &#8220;Edit&#8221; link</a> to the User profile page in the near future. Here&#8217;s a quick test I performed:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/admin-color-schemer.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13795]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/admin-color-schemer.jpg" alt="admin-color-schemer" width="787" height="437" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13829" /></a></p>\n<p>The color-picker used with this plugin provides a truly pleasant experience for exploring a full range of different hues. </p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/color-picker.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13795]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/color-picker.jpg" alt="color-picker" width="800" height="348" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13833" /></a></p>\n<p>Clicking the &#8220;Preview&#8221; button will let you see your color scheme live so that you can tweak it as necessary before saving it to use.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Options for Editing Admin Color Schemes</h3>\n<p>While testing the plugin, I found that if you click on &#8220;Show Advanced Options&#8221;, there are an additional 30 options for editing your admin color scheme. These include the ability to color the buttons, body background, links, menu background, menu current background, checked form controls and so much more. </p>\n<p>If you build websites for clients, the Admin Color Schemer provides a great option for customizing the admin to use the colors for your client&#8217;s brand. You could even go all out and try to match the colors to the front-end design. </p>\n<p>One thing to note is that this plugin is a tool for the whole admin and does not provide color schemes specific to users or their profiles.  Of course this is just the first iteration and additional features may be added down the line. If you&#8217;d like to collaborate with Helen and Mark to contribute on the project, check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/helenhousandi/admin-color-schemer" target="_blank">github repo</a>.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t trust yourself to create a decent color scheme &#8211; truly, it&#8217;s harder than it looks &#8211; you might install the <a href="http://wptavern.com/get-more-admin-color-schemes-for-wordpress-3-8" target="_blank">Admin Color Schemes</a> plugin for an assortment of eye-pleasing options. For WordPress users who are excited to try creating their own color schemes with a live preview, it looks like the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemer/" target="_blank">Admin Color Schemer</a> will be the front-runner plugin for providing the best solution with the most options.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 24 Dec 2013 22:18:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: Development Agency 10up Acquires Brainstorm Media";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=13637";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"http://wptavern.com/development-agency-10up-acquires-brainstorm-media";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3800:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10UpLogo.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13637]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10UpLogo.jpg" alt="10up Logo" width="139" height="164" class="alignright size-full wp-image-13736" /></a>Web development Agency <a title="http://10up.com/" href="http://10up.com/">10up</a> has <a href="http://10up.com/blog/brainstorm-joins-10up/" title="http://10up.com/blog/brainstorm-joins-10up/">announced</a> they have acquired <a title="http://brainstormmedia.com/" href="http://brainstormmedia.com/">Brainstorm Media</a> for an undisclosed amount. Brainstorm Media, also a WordPress development agency, was a staff of eight led by Paul Clark and Taylor Aldridge. The entire team will join 10up at the start of 2014, adding to its development capacity and strengthening the creative design arm of the company. This brings the total number of full time 10up employees to 50.</p>\n<p>While Brainstorm Media may not be familiar to you, they&#8217;ve been developing websites on top of WordPress for years. Brainstorm&#8217;s team has worked with a number of high profile clients such as Larry Fitzgerald of the Arizona Cardinals and the Wall Street Journal. A few months ago, Sarah Gooding <a title="http://wptavern.com/how-to-install-wordpress-plugins-directly-from-github" href="http://wptavern.com/how-to-install-wordpress-plugins-directly-from-github">profiled a plugin</a> created by Paul Clark called <a title="https://github.com/brainstormmedia/github-plugin-search" href="https://github.com/brainstormmedia/github-plugin-search">Github Plugin Search</a> that enables users to access and install WordPress plugins directly from your dashboard.</p>\n<p>However, Paul is most widely known throughout the WordPress community for his presentation on how <a title="http://pdclark.com/wordpress-saves-lives-moves-governments-lightning-talk/" href="http://pdclark.com/wordpress-saves-lives-moves-governments-lightning-talk/">WordPress Saves Lives and Moves Governments</a>. I&#8217;ve been told by those who have attended his sessions that he always receives a standing ovation.</p>\n<p>This acquisition is similar to the one we <a title="http://wptavern.com/crowd-favorite-acquired-by-velomedia" href="http://wptavern.com/crowd-favorite-acquired-by-velomedia">reported on</a> in the middle of November when VeloMedia acquired Crowd Favorite. When I spoke with Jake Goldman, President of 10up, and asked him why they acquired the company, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been impressed with Brainstorm since Paul, Taylor, and I met at WordCamp LA more than 2 years ago. Paul is a very unique mix of skilled software engineer, smart business leader, and inspiring speaker. Taylor&#8217;s gravitas and depth &#8211; more than two decades worth &#8211; when it comes to design is very apparent, and I&#8217;m inspired by his genuine values. Our teams share common values around contribution, quality, and work ethic, and our capacity to effectively collaborate was validated with a trial engagement. Everyone at 10up feels very lucky and excited to be joining forces with this team.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>WordPress Has A Healthy Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>This acquisition is a sign that the WordPress community as a whole is maturing. WordPress companies acquiring other WordPress companies is a signal that the WordPress ecosystem is healthy. Within the next 2-4 years, I think these acquisitions will be common place. The ecosystem is filled with WordPress development agencies that are one to ten person operations. Any of these development agencies that become mildly successful will most likely become an acquisition of talent more than anything else.</p>\n<h3>Watch Paul Clark&#8217;s WordCamp Presentation</h3>\n<div class="aligncenter"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 24 Dec 2013 20:24:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: WordCamp Miami to Celebrate 5th Anniversary in May 2014";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=13775";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-to-celebrate-5th-anniversary-in-may-2014";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4092:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/miami-header.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13775]"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/miami-header.jpg" alt="http://www.dreamstime.com/-image11969050" width="1000" height="288" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13779" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.davidbisset.com/" target="_blank">David Bisset</a> has been organizing <a href="http://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Miami</a> for the past five years. That&#8217;s a long time in WordPress years! WordCamp Miami will celebrate its five year anniversary May 23-25, 2014. </p>\n<p>The first WordCamp Miami was held in 2010, spreading the phenomenon of WordCamps to one of the largest metropolitan areas in the US. Every single year the event has sold out and attendance has steadily increased:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2010 attendance: 250 people (sold out)</li>\n<li>2011 attendance: 340 people (sold out)</li>\n<li>2012 attendance: 420 people (sold out)</li>\n<li>2013 attendance: 500 people (sold out), 1500 unique visitors via livestream</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This year the team anticipates 600 &#8211; 700 attendees. Now that the official dates have been announced, they&#8217;ve opened the event up for <a href="http://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/call-for-speakers/" target="_blank">speaker submissions</a> and <a href="http://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/become-a-sponsor/" target="_blank">sponsors</a>. They&#8217;ve also put together a <a href="http://miami.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">photo contest</a> to celebrate the 5th anniversary. Contestants are urged to take a unique WordPress or WCMIA photo and submit for a chance to win prizes from the organizers.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Miami is a fantastic example of a WordPress event done right. It&#8217;s not easy to nail down why it&#8217;s been such a successful event, because so many factors come into play. Bisset says that he doesn&#8217;t have a formula for other WordCamps to follow: </p>\n<blockquote><p>WordCamps are not all clones of each other, they each have their own mood and personality. For Miami, we&#8217;ve been wild and experimental in what we do to see what works well and what doesn&#8217;t. But we&#8217;ve always held in high regard that WordCamps in general should be about education, the social element, and networking. You don&#8217;t truly appreciate the WordPress community until you&#8217;re literally surrounded by people at a WordCamp or WordPress social event, and it&#8217;s something that you can&#8217;t fully pick up online.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Putting together a massive event like WordCamp Miami is quite a feat, but Bisset has help from his local community. The organization committee he works with has different people to help handle various aspects of the event. The team also holds a special relationship with local people from the University of Miami LaunchPad and RefreshMiami, two local tech groups that have also pitched in to help. </p>\n<p>I asked Bisset if he&#8217;ll be down for the next five years of organizing WordCamp Miami. He said he&#8217;s taking it one year at a time. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t expecting to be planning a WordCamp for this long. So, yes definitely taking it one year at a time. I think every year I say &#8220;that&#8217;s it&#8221; but that passes after a few months.&#8221; </p>\n<p>If past years are any indication, this event is bound to sell out quickly so get your tickets early if you plan to go. First time attendees are also welcome to get in on the <a href="http://miami.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">photo contest</a> for a chance to win tickets and prizes. The event will be stocked with goodies for attendees when they arrive in May in order to say thanks to the thousands of people that have supported WordCamp Miami throughout the years. The organizers have planned an amazing after party, even more exciting than last year&#8217;s dance-off that boasted an iPad as the grand prize. <a href="http://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Miami 2014</a> is ramping up to be the best event the team has put on so far.

December 19th, an update to <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/">Edit Flow</a>, a popular plugin used on multi-author blogs was released. Prior to December 19th, the most recent update was on January 30th, 2013. In <a title="http://wptavern.com/edit-flow-jetpack-and-mp6" href="http://wptavern.com/edit-flow-jetpack-and-mp6">previous articles</a>, I outlined a number of issues that nearly forced me to stop using the plugin. The latest version fixes those problems and adds a few new features.</p>\n<p>The <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/changelog/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/changelog/">changelog</a> for this release is a mile long but that&#8217;s a good thing. One of the most annoying bugs that has been addressed is that posts, pages, and custom post types can now be previewed correctly. This version also includes a new feature named <strong>Dashboard Notepad</strong>. The new dashboard widget provides an easy way to leave instructions or notes to other administrators or users of the site.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/EditFlowDashboardNotes.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13570]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13702" alt="Edit Flow Dashboard Notes" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/EditFlowDashboardNotes.jpg" width="491" height="183" /></a></p>\n<p>For those that extensively use the editorial comments functionality within Edit Flow, you&#8217;ll be pleased to know that subscriptions are now saved via AJAX, which means you can add or remove subscribers without hitting &#8220;<strong>Save Post</strong>&#8220;. This release also contains updates to the Japanese and Dutch localizations. Some other notable changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now double-click to create a new post on the calendar or edit details associated with an existing post</li>\n<li>Subscribe to a post&#8217;s updates using a quick &#8220;Follow&#8221; link on Manage Posts, the Calendar, or Story Budget</li>\n<li>Assign a date and time to editorial metadata&#8217;s date field</li>\n<li>Modify which filters are used on the calendar and story budget, or add your own</li>\n<li>Scheduled publication time is now included in relevant email notifications</li>\n<li>Calendar and story budget module descriptions link to their respective pages in the admin for usability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/EditFlowIconTooDark.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[13570]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-13700" alt="Edit Flow Icon Too Dark" src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/EditFlowIconTooDark.jpg" width="152" height="140" /></a>Since WPTavern became a multi-authored blog, Edit Flow has become an important plugin that helps manage the workflow and communication between authors. I’ve spoken to a number of people via email who love using Edit Flow. However, most of them stopped using it because of bugs and no sign of active development during 2013. One minor suggestion I have for a future update is to change the Edit Flow menu icon. It&#8217;s too hard to see when using a dark-colored admin color scheme.</p>\n<p>I hope this update is a sign of great things to come.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 15:00:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WPTavern: 22 Beautiful Free WordPress Themes From 2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=13671";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://wptavern.com/22-beautiful-free-wordpress-themes-from-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14619:"<p>2013 was an excellent year for finding beautiful themes in the official <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank">WordPress Themes Directory</a>.

But for your average user who doesn&#8217;t know how to work with Sass, creating color schemes is probably not going to happen. Fortunately, someone has created a plugin that makes custom admin color schemes available to everyone.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/hs-custom-admin-themes/" target="_blank">HS Custom Admin Theme</a> is a new free plugin that lets you create your own admin color schemes in its settings panel via a user-friendly color picker. Up until now, the only way to get alternative color schemes was to <a href="http://wptavern.com/get-more-admin-color-schemes-for-wordpress-3-8" target="_blank">use a plugin</a> or go through the process of <a href="http://mattcromwell.com/create-custom-wordpress-admin-color-scheme/" target="_blank">rolling your own</a>.</p>\n<p>The HS Custom Admin Theme plugin makes it easy to design your own color palettes for the WordPress admin area, without knowing any CSS. Here&#8217;s an example of a custom color scheme I created on a test site:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/customcolors.png" rel="prettyphoto[13646]" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/customcolors.png" alt="customcolors" width="900" height="654" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13649" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin records all of the color schemes you create and test so that you can always return to one made previously. You can essentially create a library of your favorite color palettes and change the admin according to your mood. </p>\n<h3>A few suggestions</h3>\n<p>There are a few things I would change about how this plugin works. The most important one is the non-native placement of its settings panel. I would prefer the plugin placed its settings under the &#8220;Edit My Profile&#8221; screen where users are already trained to look for admin color schemes. It would also be really cool if each color selection updated live while editing. Other than that, the plugin works well for allowing users to make their own color selections and store them as a custom theme.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/hs-custom-admin-themes/" target="_blank">HS Custom Admin Theme</a> is the first plugin of its kind, but I anticipate there will be many more like it hitting the repository soon. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 11:03:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WordPress.tv: Kurt Hansen: Are You Nuts?

[…]</div></li></ul></div><div class="rss-widget"><ul><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''http://wptavern.com/cloudup-makes-file-sharing-incredibly-easy'' title=''Cloudup is a file sharing service that was acquired by Automattic on September 25th, 2013. Their goal is to make file sharing “simple and beautiful.” Not having any experience with Dropbox, Cloudup was amazingly easy to set up and start using. In the past, I used FTP to upload images I wanted to share to a folder I had access to. This was a cumbersome approach to file sharing but it worked. Installation Of The Cloudup App Cloudup supports Mac and Windows for the desktop while iOS and Android apps are available for mobile devices. The installer is 28MB in size which makes for a quick download. Once installed, you’ll need to link the app to your Cloudup account. The service is still invite only but if you visit this invitation link, you’ll gain access immediately.  After the account has been linked, you can access the dashboard and preferences by clicking on the small Cloudup icon located within the Taskbar. Using Cloudup There are two primary ways to upload content. You can either drag files to the taskbar icon or click on the icon, then select Upload/Browse. When a file is uploaded, the app will automatically open the file in a new browser window and copy the unique URL to the clipboard for easy sharing. From within this browser window, you can choose whether the image is public or private, edit the image title, or add a password. Cloudup Editor After Uploading A File In its simplest form, it only takes two steps to share a file. The first is to upload it. The second is to paste the URL to whomever you want to have access to the file. Also, users don’t have to wait until the entire file is uploaded before sharing the URL. Free Accounts Limited To 1,000 Items Cloudup Free Users Limited To 1,000 Items New users are automatically placed into the free tier. This tier is the only one available at the moment and gives users 1,000 items. According to Matt Mullenweg in a Techcrunch article covering the acquisition, there are no plans to monetize the service. We think Cloudup is something intrinsically useful to have in the world, and Automattic’s core businesses in WordPress.com, VIP, VaultPress, and Akismet are doing more than well enough for us as a company. Each item has a maximum size limit of 200MB. Depending on what you’re streaming, this is equal to 200GB of free space. This amount is incredibly generous. WordPress Media Library Improvements One of the most exciting things to come out of the acquisition announcement was the fact that the WordPress media library would be improved by leaps and bounds thanks to Cloudup’s technology. One of the major improvements the team would be focusing on is collaborative editing. Similar to how Google docs functions, two authors would be able to work together on a single blog post at the same time using the visual editor. First WordPress.com Then Jetpack Users of WordPress.com will be the first to reap the benefits of any WordPress media library improvements. However, thanks to Jetpack, self-hosted WordPress users won’t be far behind. If you don’t use Jetpack, Cloudup can still be used by multiple devices without requiring WordPress. Will Cloudup Replace The WordPress Media Library? It’s hard for me to picture WordPress without the media library we’ve used for years. Replacing the media library on WordPress.com with Cloudup makes a lot of sense but I wonder how that change would translate to the self hosted version of WordPress. I asked Matt Mullenweg if Cloudup is something he can see replacing the WordPress media library or would there always be a need to keep things local? His response: “I could see it replacing it“. What it means to replace the library and how it would work is still unknown. However, when I asked WPTavern Twitter followers what they thought about the idea of replacing the library with something hosted in the cloud, here are a few of their responses: @wptavern Do not want. Own your data = it&#039;s all on *your* server, not someone else&#039;s. — Kim Parsell (@kimparsell) January 4, 2014  @wptavern sounds great especially if you ever need to move/migrate site — Forge (@djforge) January 4, 2014  @wptavern Isn&#039;t this essentially a simple CDN? OK as an option/plugin, but not default. — TJ List (@TJList) January 4, 2014  Matt has been a vocal supporter of the idea to own your own data. It’s one of the many reasons so many people use WordPress so I doubt any media library replacement would go against that ethos. Conclusion Cloudup is awesome. It’s the simplest way to share files I’ve come across. It’s also lightning fast. While there are no plans to lift the private beta anytime soon, if you use this invitation link you’ll get immediate access. After gaining access, consider installing the Cloudup oEmbed plugin to show Cloudup hosted files within a post without using any special embed code.''>WPTavern: Cloudup Makes File Sharing Incredibly Easy</a></li><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''http://wptavern.com/help-solve-my-wordpress-archive-conundrum'' title=''During the past few days, I’ve been experimenting with a variety of WordPress plugins that specifically deal with the archiving of posts. Most allow archives to be generated via short code on a page while others are simply widgets with different configuration options. Some of the plugins I tested displayed every post ever published which not only inundated visitors, but was a bad use of resources on the server. I eventually found a plugin that had what I was looking for but since installing it, I’ve been faced with a conundrum. A Simple Way To Display Archives With Compact Archives Plugin I initially wanted to create an archive page so that all of our previous content would be easy to find. To me, WPTavern is a continuously updated archive of WordPress information. Making it easy to find all of the previous knowledge that’s been published within the past six years is important, especially since it’s all tied to one specific subject. For displaying the archive, I settled on the Compact Archives plugin by Syed Balkhi and Noumaan Yaqoob. I like this plugin because it provides a few different ways via shortcode to display the entire archive of posts. The display is not pretty and doesn’t include images but then again, the main goal is to make it easy to browse the history of WordPress Tavern.  Search Box or Dedicated Archive Page Once I completed the archive page, I questioned whether or not the work was all for nothing. If you think about it, the search function of WordPress should be able to handle finding previously published content. As long as the search functionality provided relevant results, it would be the only form of archive retrieval needed. I decided to browse around to see how other large WordPress centric sites are archiving their content. Most of them don’t contain a dedicated archive page and handle everything through their search box. What Would You Do? So this is the conundrum I’m in, whether to create a dedicated archive page or just have visitors use the search box. I could use both methods but then they become a another page and plugin that needs to be maintained. There are two questions I have. The first is what would you do? The second, how do you archive a WordPress powered site with years of posts?''>WPTavern: Help Solve My WordPress Archive Conundrum</a></li><li><a class=''rsswidget'' href=''http://wptavern.com/wp-caregiver-30-wordpress-tweaks-in-1-convenient-plugin'' title=''WP Caregiver is a hidden gem of a plugin that arrived in the WordPress repository nearly six months ago. The plugin was recently featured on Tidy Repo, a site dedicated to testing and curating WordPress plugins. Surprisingly, it has only received a handful of downloads, though it has the potential to replace multiple plugins that you may already have in place to handle small WordPress tweaks. WP Caregiver is essentially a long list of light switches for core WordPress features and functions. It provides an organized way to turn these on or off at will and is separated into three tabbed categories: Frontend Features, Backend Features and System Information. System Information System Information lets you quickly view your server time, memory usage and SQL queries. It also gives you a quick and easy way to delete all of your post revisions and calculate the disc usage for your site.  Frontend Features The Frontend tweaks include the ability to easily remove a bunch of extras that many WordPress users don’t use, such as post relational links, website URL field in the comment form, the admin bar, and more. This screen also contains the ability to quickly enable the Open Graph tags generator. One really useful feature is the option to easily enable “Quick Maintenance Mode” with a checkbox. No need to install a separate plugin for creating a maintenance page.   Backend Features Backend tweaks include the ability to turn off update notifications, hide login error messages, enable excerpt field for pages, enable TinyMCE Editor for excerpt, enable categories for pages and many more handy little changes. The ability to customize the WordPress mail name and address from this screen is a convenient little addition.  WordPress was made to be customized. Removing extras in the core features can help to make your custom WordPress installation leaner. The 30+ options offered in WP Caregiver cover many of the most commonly applied WordPress tweaks. Many thanks to the folks at Blint Design for putting this handy collection of tweaks into one convenient plugin.

The management and development of the plugin has been taken over by <a href="http://hmn.md">Human Made Limited</a> the chaps behind <a href="https://wpremote.com">WP Remote</a></p>\n\n<h4>Previous</h4>\n\n<p>Version 0.4.5 and previous were developed by <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/wpdprx/">wpdprx</a></p>";s:3:"faq";s:4053:"<p><strong>Where does BackUpWordPress store the backup files?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Backups are stored on your server in <code>/wp-content/backups</code>, you can change the directory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> By default BackUpWordPress backs up everything in your site root as well as your database, this includes any non WordPress folders that happen to be in your site root. This does means that your backup directory can get quite large.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I restore my site from a backup?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You need to download the latest backup file either by clicking download on the backups page or via <code>FTP</code>. <code>Unzip</code> the files and upload all the files to your server overwriting your site. You can then import the database using your hosts database management tool (likely <code>phpMyAdmin</code>).</p>\n\n<p>See this post for more details <a href="http://hmn.md/backupwordpress-how-to-restore-from-backup-files/" rel="nofollow">http://hmn.md/backupwordpress-how-to-restore-from-backup-files/</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does BackUpWordPress back up the backups directory?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I''m not receiving my backups by email</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most servers have a filesize limit on email attachments, it''s generally about 10mb. If your backup file is over that limit it won''t be sent attached to the email, instead you should receive an email with a link to download the backup, if you aren''t even receiving that then you likely have a mail issue on your server that you''ll need to contact your host about.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How many backups are stored by default?</strong></p>\n\n<p>BackUpWordPress stores the last 10 backups by default.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long should a backup take?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Unless your site is very large (many gigabytes) it should only take a few minutes to perform a back up, if your back up has been running for longer than an hour it''s safe to assume that something has gone wrong, try de-activating and re-activating the plugin, if it keeps happening, contact support.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do I do if I get the wp-cron error message</strong></p>\n\n<p>The issue is that your <code>wp-cron.php</code> is not returning a <code>200</code> response when hit with a http request originating from your own server, it could be several things, most of the time it''s an issue with the server / site and not with BackUpWordPress.</p>\n\n<p>Some things you can test are.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are scheduled posts working? (They use wp-cron too).</li>\n<li>Are you hosted on Heart Internet? (wp-cron is known not to work with them).</li>\n<li>If you click manual backup does it work?</li>\n<li>Try adding <code>define( ''ALTERNATE_WP_CRON'', true ); to your</code>wp-config.php`, do automatic backups work?</li>\n<li>Is your site private (I.E. is it behind some kind of authentication, maintenance plugin, .htaccess) if so wp-cron won''t work until you remove it, if you are and you temporarily remove the authentication, do backups start working?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have tried all these then feel free to contact support.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to get BackUpWordPress working in Heart Internet</strong></p>\n\n<p>The script to be entered into the Heart Internet cPanel is: <code>/usr/bin/php5 /home/sites/yourdomain.com/public_html/wp-cron.php</code> (note the space between php5 and the location of the file). The file <code>wp-cron.php</code> <code>chmod</code> must be set to <code>711</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Further Support &#38; Feedback</strong></p>\n\n<p>General support questions should be posted in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/backupwordpress?forum_id=10">WordPress support forums, tagged with backupwordpress.</a></p>\n\n<p>For development issues, feature requests or anybody wishing to help out with development checkout <a href="https://github.com/humanmade/backupwordpress/">BackUpWordPress on GitHub.</a></p>\n\n<p>You can also tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/humanmadeltd">@humanmadeltd</a> or email <a href="mailto:support@hmn.md">support@hmn.md</a> for further help/support.</p>";}s:13:"download_link";s:64:"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/backupwordpress.2.3.3.zip";s:4:"tags";a:10:{s:7:"archive";s:7:"archive";s:7:"back-up";s:7:"back up";s:6:"backup";s:6:"backup";s:7:"backups";s:7:"backups";s:8:"database";s:8:"database";s:2:"db";s:2:"db";s:5:"files";s:5:"files";s:9:"humanmade";s:9:"humanmade";s:6:"wp-cli";s:6:"wp-cli";s:3:"zip";s:3:"zip";}s:11:"donate_link";N;}', 'no'),

This can occur if your cornea has too little curvature or the length of your eyeball is too short, causing nearby objects unable to be brought into a clearly focused sharp image. This condition can be brought on by environmental factors or be a hereditary issue.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is Hyperopia a common problem?</strong>\r\n\r\nMany people suffer from mild cases of farsightedness without ever knowing it and it is far more common than you may think. Hyperopia only becomes an obvious problem if it has a significant effect on your ability to see things in everyday life, for instance while driving. As you age, it is normal to experience a natural decrease in focusing ability is normal, over half of the people who wear glasses are attempting to assist with their hyperopia or presbyopia (nearsightedness). Hyperopia can be easily overlooked during sight test or auto refraction, making it necessary to visit your optometrist regularly to keep track of your refractive error and find the perfect glasses prescription for your particular gauge of hyperopia.\r\n\r\n<strong>What symptoms occur from farsightedness?</strong>\r\n\r\nThose who are suffering from Hyperopia will naturally exert extra effort to maintain clear vision of long distance and even more involuntary effort to view objects at a close range.  This extra energy being used to see clearly can cause tension, fatigue, headaches and discomfort. Blurred vision will also occur in the event that the crystalline lens of the eye cannot bring an object into focus.\r\n\r\n<strong>Common Symptoms of Hyperopia Include:</strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Trouble maintaining clear focus on near objects</li>\r\n<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>\r\n<li>Eye strain</li>\r\n<li>Fatigue</li>\r\n<li>Headaches</li>\r\n<li.Aching or burning eyes</li>\r\n<li>Poor reading ability</li>\r\n<li>General tension</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>How can I detect and treat my Hyperopia?</strong>\r\n\r\nSight testing and common vision screenings can be ineffective in assigning the right diagnosis for hyperopia. Our common association with letters, allows us to assign the correct letter on the eye chart by shape association with no relation to amount of focus on the letter itself. The best way to detect your farsightedness is through a comprehensive optometric examination at one of our 4 convenient office locations to receive a full screening for Hyperopia and any other eye related ailments. Once we have assessed your issues and detected Hyperopia in your ocular system, there are multiple options for treatment depending on your particular case. If case where the farsightedness is mild, your eyes may be able to naturally correct themselves without the use of corrective lenses, but you may need glasses for reading and computer use. If the case is severe, you may be prescribed glasses for full time use and perhaps open options for corrective laser surgery. Although it may take some time to adjust to wearing glasses, farsightedness will not significantly affect your lifestyle as long as you are receiving proper treatment. Attending Drs.

Blurred vision will also occur in the event that the crystalline lens of the eye cannot bring an object into focus.\r\n\r\n<strong>Common Symptoms of Hyperopia Include:</strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Trouble maintaining clear focus on near objects</li>\r\n<li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>\r\n<li>Eye strain</li>\r\n<li>Fatigue</li>\r\n<li>Headaches</li>\r\n<li.Aching or burning eyes</li>\r\n<li>Poor reading ability</li>\r\n<li>General tension</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>How can I detect and treat my Hyperopia?</strong>\r\n\r\nSight testing and common vision screenings can be ineffective in assigning the right diagnosis for hyperopia. Our common association with letters, allows us to assign the correct letter on the eye chart by shape association with no relation to amount of focus on the letter itself. The best way to detect your farsightedness is through a comprehensive optometric examination at one of our 4 convenient office locations to receive a full screening for Hyperopia and any other eye related ailments. Once we have assessed your issues and detected Hyperopia in your ocular system, there are multiple options for treatment depending on your particular case. If case where the farsightedness is mild, your eyes may be able to naturally correct themselves without the use of corrective lenses, but you may need glasses for reading and computer use. If the case is severe, you may be prescribed glasses for full time use and perhaps open options for corrective laser surgery. Although it may take some time to adjust to wearing glasses, farsightedness will not significantly affect your lifestyle as long as you are receiving proper treatment. Attending Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle Developmental Optometry and Vision Therapy Services for a regular check up every six months is necessary to keep vision at the highest levels of performance.', 'Hyperopia', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-01-03 11:08:44', '2014-01-03 11:08:44', '', 23, 'http://localhost/wordpress/davisvisiontherapy/?p=25', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Aug. 16, 2011</strong> - This August, as children head back to schools which have reduced budgets, National Children’s Vision & Learning Month takes on new meaning.  Teachers and administrators now need to be more creative in order to help their students succeed.  This may include challenging previous concepts regarding vision and learning.<!--more-->\n<br/>Two educators from New Jersey have shed some light on why teachers and administrators across the US are rethinking their model of vision and how it relates to learning.  Many students with attention problems, learning disabilities, and gifted students that don’t achieve to their potential have one thing in common, vision disorders that have contributed to their learning difficulties.\n<br/>Nicole Moore, Principal of Indian Mills Elementary School, shares, <em>“As a principal who sits on the intervention services committee, we try to do whatever is possible to stop children from needing to be classified for special education services.  One of the interventions that parents have told me makes a big difference in their children’s ability to read and learn is optometric vision therapy.”</em>\n<br/><em>“Our district has one of the lowest rates of student classification for special education in the county,”</em> Moore continues, <em>“I believe screening and remediation of learning-related vision problems have been a significant factor in reducing the number of children referred for special education services.”</em>\n<br/>Moore credits Barbara Scola, the Director of Pupil Services, for bringing optometric vision therapy to her school as one of the many interventions necessary to help their students.\n<br/>When asked what prompted Scola to consider that vision might be one of the missing links to helping students learn, she recalled, <em>“I was working on my master’s thesis on reading interventions and had the opportunity to work with a student who had excellent comprehension when the material was read to him, but struggled when he tried to read on his own.” </em> \n<br/>As she worked with him she found that he knew his words in isolation, yet when he saw the same words at the beginning of a line in a paragraph he didn’t recognize them because he cut off the first two letters.  For example, <em>“Treat yourself to some ice cream”</em> he would read as <em>“Eat yourself to some ice cream.”</em>  Scola tried teaching him context clues to help it make sense, to force him to go back and look at the beginnings of the words, but it was laborious.\n<br/><em>“This was quite a mystery, so I started researching to see what it could be.  I suspected that his vision might be playing a role, so I started searching for information on learning disabilities and vision.  And that’s what lead me to optometric vision therapy,”</em> Scola continued.   \n<br/>Following Scola’s recommendation, the mother took her child to an optometrist who had an in-office vision therapy program.  After completing optometric vision therapy, he did very well in school.\n<br/>Once Scola received her Master’s Degree in Education Administration, she joined Moore in the Shamong School District as the Director of Pupil Services and began implementing her new strategies. The mother of one of the first children who went through optometric vision therapy was working on her Ph.D. in Reading. Scola had encouraged her to give vision therapy a try, <em>“she did not believe us at all, she thought it was bunk. Even with all of her education she had never heard of it. But her daughter couldn''t read, so we said it can''t hurt, just try it.”</em> And now her daughter is an avid reader and an excellent student thanks to optometric vision therapy.  \n<br/><strong>Some of the most common signs that a pupil may have a learning related vision disorder are:</strong>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Homework battles even though the child is bright and may do well in school (because their eyes are tired at the end of the day from straining to focus),</li>\n	<li>Tilts head or lays head on the desk during reading</li>\n	<li>Short attention span when reading</li>\n	<li>Poor reading comprehension</li>\n	<li>Skips lines, rereads lines.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>Moore encourages other principals and administrators to "<em>think outside the box when it comes to learning or reading issues; I had never heard of optometric vision therapy before.  Now we know what to look for in children with possible vision disorders and with vision therapy we have seen significant changes in these children’s’ ability and enjoyment of reading."</em>\n<br/>Moore and Scola (now the Director of Special Services at Winslow Schools) were delighted to learn that the American Optometric Association responded to President Obama''s call to ensure that no child is left behind in the classroom due to an undetected or untreated eye or vision disorder, by holding a School Readiness Summit in Washington, DC.  The summit''s interdisciplinary workgroup - comprising nearly 50 leaders in their respective fields - documented and recognized the established link between healthy vision and classroom learning.\n<br/>As a result of this Summit, the American Federation of Teachers issued the following statement: <em>“Even the most gifted students will struggle academically if they have trouble seeing the blackboard or focusing on a book. A tremendous amount of learning happens visually, so proper vision care is crucial to helping students reach their full potential.”</em>\n<br/>Scola explains to parents, <em>“It doesn’t matter if your child is gifted or not, if vision isn’t working right, your eyes don’t send the right signals to your brain.  It’s like having a real high speed computer, but if the keyboard isn''t working, you get the wrong information, if any.”  </em>\n<br/>Dr. Tod R. Davis, a developmental optometrist who has an office in Fredericksburg, VA, and who diagnoses and treats vision problems that interfere with academic success says, <em>“I have seen a lot of children from  all over the Prince William County area who struggled with reading before the underlying vision problem was found and treated.  I hope that educators in our area are inspired by what Ms. Scola and Ms. Moore have done in their schools.”</em>\n<br/>Dr. Bradley Habermehl, President of the College of Optometrists in Vision Development (COVD) concurs, <em>“We are delighted to see educators, such as Ms. Moore and Ms. Scola, embracing optometric vision therapy.  We receive large numbers of thank you letters from parents who were at their wits end, thanking vision therapy for changing the lives of their children.”</em>\n<br/>Please join COVD in this year’s campaign for National Children’s Vision & Learning Month and visit us at www.COVD.org where you can learn about how vision disorders can cause even the brightest children to struggle with learning.\n<br/>\n<strong>About Developmental Optometry & Vision Therapy Services</strong>\nDevelopmental Optometry & Vision Therapy Services, operated under Dr. Tod Davis, is a talented and compassionate staff that specializes in developmental vision care and vision therapy.

Davis</em>\n\nRecently, the new 3D technology has been receiving a significant amount of attention, especially with the option of 3D at the theaters, a new Nintendo 3DS, classroom use of 3D technology, and even 3D home televisions. The American Optometric Association, with the explosion of 3D technology, has issued a public health warning article titled “3D in the Classroom: See Well, Learn Well.” The purpose of the article is to educate the public about people who are uncomfortable with watching 3D, as there have been an increasing number of these reports.\n\nWhat does it mean to be uncomfortable with viewing 3D on a screen? In most cases, this is a strong sign of a binocular vision disorder, such as convergence insufficiency. <!--more-->Convergence insufficiency is when the eyes have issues working together at close range, also known as an eye teaming problem, where the eyes drift out despite trying to do near work. In an effort to keep the eyes working, the individual has to: make an extra effort to bring the eyes together (which causes fatigue, headache, etc.); cover one eye; or, the brain will actually suppress the vision in one eye, all to avoid swimming letters and double vision.\n\nSome people have said that if watching 3D movies bothers an individual, than that individual should simply not look at 3D screens. However, the reality is that an issue with viewing 3D properly is strong evidence that there’s a problem with the viewer’s binocular vision.\n\nThere has always been 3D for people: The real world and binocular vision work together to create the same effect. In fact, 3D viewing technologies enable us to screen for vision disorders in a new and very efficient way: When someone with a vision disorder watches a program or movie, or plays a game which utilizes this technology, they suffer from the “3D’s of Viewing 3D: dizziness, discomfort and lack of depth.” This is also known as 3D Vision Syndrome, and it reveals vision disorders such as convergence insufficiency.\n\nHere is the good news: binocular conditions such as convergence insufficiency are treatable. This is where vision therapy comes in. Vision therapy can help a child (or an adult, even) with eye teaming issues. People that struggle to do work at close range – or that struggle to watch 3D screens – don’t have to continue to struggle, and through the work of vision therapy they can retrain the eyes to work together properly, giving them both excellent binocular vision in real life, and the ability to watch 3D screens.\n\nIn addition, viewing anything in 3D, be it a video game, movie, or television program, has no worse impact on the viewer than the 2D equivalent. Certainly, you should limit the viewing of television, especially for children; yet, this is true whether the television is in 2D or 3D. This makes 3D technology a boon to schools, homes, and theaters as more and more people are “tested” for vision disorders (such as convergence insufficiency) in the name of education and fun!\n\nI maintain that for these reasons, the increase in 3D technology is a good thing. The use of the 3D technology has been, and will continue to be, extremely helpful in the diagnosis of vision disorders such as convergence insufficiency.\n\n<strong>Sources &amp; Resources:</strong>\n“3D in the Classroom: See Well, Learn Well” editorial by Dominick M.

A child may not necessarily be exhibiting signs of a learning issue (such as fussing over homework or showing a slower progression among their classmates) in order for a vision disorder to be present. Even children who are otherwise gifted learners can still suffer from vision disorders. Therefore, convergence insufficiency, amblyopia, and other disorders of vision are not and should not be attributed only to “slow learners” or “reluctant readers.”\n<!--more-->\nDifficulty learning is usually the sign of a vision problem that most parents pay attention to. Because of this, it is often the case that an intelligent child is not brought in for diagnosis until their academic performance suffers. At this point, the parents are often confused by the child’s struggles in certain areas. The parents may even mistake the reduced performance, such as on a written test, as a sign of laziness in the child. These children are often performing adequately enough to not qualify for additional in-school help, which can reinforce this assumption.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the gifted child may otherwise be extremely verbal, and do perfectly on verbal tests. In fact, he or she may be able to answer questions on a written test correctly when asked them verbally. When there is a disparity such as this, seeking a thorough vision screening should be a parent’s immediate reaction. A functional vision test goes far beyond the “20/20” eye chart examination with which we are all so familiar. This vision assessment tests the full range visual health factors, including eye tracking, eye teaming and convergence. By testing all aspects of vision, this screening uncovers vision disorders such as convergence insufficiency, amblyopia, eye-teaming issues and computer vision syndrome.\n\nWhen such disorders come to light, the good news is that they are often treatable without surgery or glasses. Vision therapy, a series of exercises meant to re-train the eyes to function according to their intended function, corrects a wide variety of vision disorders. The result is that the child is better able to see and interpret written materials, allowing their natural giftedness to shine through all the more.', 'Gifted Children and Vision Disorders', 'It might come as a surprise, but there are gifted children that have vision disorders.

However, with symptoms that often are similar to each other, vision disorders in children may sometimes be misdiagnosed as ADHD.\n<!--more-->\nConvergence insufficiency is a common visual disorder which affects the coordination of the eyes. An estimated 1 in 20 children suffer from convergence insufficiency. But, what is convergence insufficiency? First, let me explain the concept of convergence: When reading, writing, drawing, or doing other work that requires up-close attention, a person’s eyes must turn in, or converge, in order for the image of the work to be clear. \n\nConvergence happens smoothly and subconsciously in those without convergence insufficiency. However, those who suffer from the disorder have difficulty turning their eyes inward. As a result, conscious effort must be made to focus on close objects, which is very tiring. \n\nHave you ever crossed your eyes? Imagine feeling like you had to do that in order to read, and imagine being expected to maintain that focus for minutes or even hours at a time. This is how reading feels to those with convergence insufficiency. It’s no wonder they have difficulty focusing on their work! \n\nThis extra exertion, naturally, causes a number of uncomfortable symptoms, such as eyestrain, headaches and blurred vision. Children with convergence insufficiency may experience difficulty concentrating, read slowly, read the same line repeatedly, have trouble remembering what they read, or frequently lose their place. This may result in inattentiveness at school and while completing homework, or a general avoidance of such close work.\n\nHere’s the problem: To a parent, or even a medical practitioner, all of these symptoms suggest ADHD. Those with convergence insufficiency may even have 20/20 vision, further complicating diagnoses. In a 2000 study, it was demonstrated that children diagnosed with ADHD are three times more likely to have convergence insufficiency than children who have not been so diagnosed. Clearly, there is reason to believe that some of those children would not need ADHD medications if their struggle with convergence insufficiency was to be fully addressed and treated. \n\nThis is why we recommend the following: If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, or is exhibiting some of the signs of convergence insufficiency or ADHD, a thorough developmental vision exam by a developmental optometrist should be your first step in treating the disorder. It’s a decision that could save your child the stigma of being diagnosed with ADHD, and save you money on medications.', 'How Convergence Insufficiency Can Sometimes Act Like ADHD', 'If your child has trouble focusing on reading, writing, or a homework assignment for more than 15 minutes at a time, you have probably been told that his or her symptoms suggest Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as the underlying cause.

Kelsey Conway came to Dr. Davis when she was 16 years old with “major eye problems” and the help she received from vision therapy has allowed her to become successful in life.  According to Cindy Conway, Kelsey’s mother, five years after vision therapy she has recently graduated from Mary Washington with a B. A. in Historic Preservation and a minor in Museum Studies.  Not only did Kelsey graduate in four years, but she achieved Summa Cum Laude!  She was able to achieve this goal with no special help or accommodations.  She hopes to pursue a master’s degree, but is currently looking for a job in her field.  Kelsey’s inspiring testimony below was written after she had received a year’s worth of vision therapy at age 17:\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>I don’t think that I will ever forget when Dr. Davis looked at me and stated frankly, “You have major eye problems.”  I cried right then and there.  It was an answer, yes, to a question that had been hanging over me since second grade.  Unfortunately, it was in no way, shape, or form the answer I had wanted.  It didn’t matter that over half the population of the United States have these problems.  What is half a country at a time when one feels entirely alone?  I was scared, furious, and truly devastated.\n\nFrom the time I was small, I had odd little quirks.  When I wasn’t knocking into things or falling down for no apparent reason, (I did this so often my parents nicknamed me Lump Head and gave me a theme song), I was making silly errors in school, which resembled Dyslexia.  My most serious defect was in spelling.  Even after years of rules and phonics, I would spell the same word three different ways in one paper.  Reading was second in line on my list of grievances.  I read slowly, stumbling often and misreading entire sentences.  Math, though least defined, was just as exasperating.  The number of errors my work contained was just as embarrassing as it was frustrating.  Because these difficulties persisted, when I was 16 years old my parents called in the help of a tutor.  The tutor realized that I did not need her expertise, so I was sent to Fredericksburg Learning Center for testing.  These tests revealed that I did not have Dyslexia, but that the answer to my problems lay in an area of vision we had never heard of before, Developmental Optometry.  It was then that Dr. Davis diagnosed me with Binocular Fusion Disorder, using these three terrible words, “major eye problems.”\n\nBinocular Fusion Disorder can be described as visual overload.  My eyes do not work together to send my brain correct, easily processed information.  This causes my brain to simply shut off certain functions of my eyes.  Periphery is one thing my brain annihilated, giving me tunnel vision.  It also represses whichever of my eyes is acting up, and generally wreaks havoc on my ability to connect the sensory dots.  I do not know if my brain does this out of desperation or revenge, but I am now working to train my eyes to get along and have my brain stay out of their business.  Weekly therapy sessions with Dr. and Mrs. Davis and the support from my wonderful family, have helped me through this whole mess.\n\nI had a lot of issues getting over the initial shock and denial, which accompanied my diagnosis. Then came a blatant loathe and resistance to the many therapy exercises including ‘Stick Near Far’, ‘The Star Chart’, and ‘The Duck and Pigeon’.

Here are some of those questions:\n<!--more-->\n<strong>Does Hair Obstruct Vision Totally?</strong>\n\nFor the claim that hair in your eyes causes vision problems to hold much water, it would have to be demonstrable that the presence of hair over one’s eye obscures vision from that eye just as much as would wearing an eye patch. We suppose that this is theoretically possible, but would require a particularly thick volume of hair over that eye. Such a thick lock would probably not be kept over the eye, however, as it would rob the person of their ability to see depth effectively. If the wearer of such a hairstyle were involved in any sports, they would quickly see the need for keeping this amount of hair out of their eyes. This leads directly into our next question:\n\n<strong>What is the Minimum Duration of Obstruction before Losing Vision?</strong>\n\nSince we can surmise that an athlete would always keep their theoretically single-eye-blinding hair out of their eyes during a sporting event, we’ll pretend this is a non-athlete. We know that patching is used as part of lazy eye treatments, and is particularly effective against refractive amblyopia. However, even the best-case treatment requires patching for at least 2 – 8 hours per day for 3 months or longer, and this period of patching should be consecutive for best results. \n\nWe also know that the vision in the non-lazy eye tends to recover quickly after patching. Thus, for hair obstruction of vision to work the <em>other</em> way and cause vision <em>loss</em> would require more consecutive obstruction for a longer period of time. Let’s pretend that this would happen at 10 hours per day over the course of one year. Now we have to ask just one more question.\n\n<strong>What is the Likelihood of a “Hair Flip” Occurring During those 10 Hours?\n</strong>\nThink about it. Better yet, look at the picture on the link above. Justin Bieber’s hair is out of his eyes for that picture. How frequently does one specifically move their hair out of their eyes, either for pictures or because their hair is annoying them in its present position? It is highly unlikely that someone would willingly leave their hair in their eyes for 10 hours at one time. In fact, it would take a rather conscious effort by them to not move their hair (or do any activity which might move their hair) for their hair to, in fact, stay put for 10 hours on end.\n\nRemember, this is assuming that the hair caused a perfect obstruction akin to an eye patch. Anything which did not cause this obstruction would most certainly not cause the vision of an eye to become blurry (though it certainly might obstruct vision). Perhaps the Australian ophthalmologist will someday develop some research which demonstrates by what mechanism thick bangs can cause vision loss, but with what we currently know about the eye, vision and vision disorders, this hardly seems plausible.', 'Can Long Bangs Cause Lazy Eye?', 'One Australian ophthalmologist believes that haircuts with long bangs, like the style popularized by Justin Bieber, could cause lazy eye due to the eye’s vision being obstructed.

Vision therapy allows for better tracking, better depth perception, better balance, better hand-eye coordination, and even better response time because the visual system has been trained to register faster.\n<!--more-->\nWe’ve had numerous referrals from families with stories that go like this: George goes through a year of vision therapy, and the next year joins the same sports team he was in last year, say baseball, with his friend Johnny.  Johnny’s parents are so impressed with George’s improved performance compared to the previous year that they ask George’s parents what sports camp they put George through.  George’s parents simply reply, “We didn’t.  George had vision therapy.”  So, Johnny’s parents investigate vision therapy, and decide they want vision therapy for Johnny too – not because he’s showing obvious signs of a vision disorder, but because they have seen the results of what training the eyes to work with the brain-to-hand motion can do for a child.\n\nOn a national level, over the last several years, there has been more attention given to the benefits of vision therapy for athletes. There was an article in the Washington Times on June 13th titled “Eyes Have It With Help of Special Spectacles,” in which several players on the Washington National’s team are using the Nike Strobe glasses, another method of vision therapy.  (We actually will be providing these through the office for those that are interested.)  This has been the norm with most sports teams, where a few select players on a team receive vision therapy.\n\nThis particular article titled “High Performance Vision Training Improves Batting Statistics for University of Cincinnati Baseball Players” that I am responding to, however, is unusual in that the whole-team participated.  The team’s batting average – the team, not a single player – “increased from 0.251 in 2010 to 0.285 in 2011 and the slugging percentage increased by 0.033.  The rest of the Big East’s slugging percentage fell over that same time frame 0.082.”  For those not familiar with baseball, this is huge, especially for an entire team’s batting average.\n\nI suspect that vision therapy – eye vision training – is going to become more integrated into sports and sports training for both children, as well as adults in the upcoming years, and I think this article speaks towards that.\n\n<em><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029109 " target="_blank">“High-Performance Vision Training Improves Batting Statistics for University of Cincinnati Baseball Players”</a> by Joseph F.

This can be especially frustrating if your health insurance covers other kinds of therapy.\n\nOn top of this, truly effective vision therapy requires a one-on-one therapist with at-home exercises, which can increase the cost versus a computerized vision therapy regimen or completely at-home exercises, which research has shown to be no more effective than a placebo.\n\nSo what are you to do?  Your child obviously shows signs of vision disorders, and more than likely your son or daughter’s enjoyment of life, school, learning, and even sports has been negatively affected by their struggles with their vision.  Yet the sheer cost of vision therapy is enough to make people balk.\n\nOftentimes, we like to point out to those that are this stage, that vision therapy can be related to braces.  Health insurance doesn’t cover all of the cost of braces for most people.  And yet people simply put priority on getting their child braces and make it happen financially.  Although for some people braces are to address a painful or upcoming issue, many people get braces for purely cosmetic reasons.\n\nKeeping in mind that vision therapy affects multiple facets of your ability to read, retain, and process information, and even in day-to-day life in areas of balance and the ability to measure depth and distance in our three-dimensional world, how much more important is vision therapy compared to a cosmetic reason?  We’re not here to say you should pick vision therapy over braces – please, by no means think that – but sometimes we find that people’s priorities for their child’s or even their own are skewed to think that vision therapy is not that important.\n\nWe not just trying to sell you on this, either; we perform our jobs eagerly to see our patients’ eyes light up as they realize they no longer see everything doubled up, or words stop blurring, or they can pitch, catch, and bat a baseball, or they stop bumping into corners, or they’re able to sit down and learn when before it was too tiring and caused a headache. The increased confidence, the relief as their struggle to learn is removed, and the smiles are why we do what we do.\n\nNow, this doesn’t remove the obstacle of cost, especially if your health insurance won’t help.  We here at Developmental Optometry &amp; Vision Therapy Services know you have a family to feed, a mortgage to pay, cars to maintain, and lives to live.

The problem is this: Despite randomized controlled trials, or RCTs, which demonstrate the effectiveness of vision therapy for the treatment of convergence insufficiency, many eye doctors still fail to test for the disorder.

The Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (or CITT) conclusively demonstrates that convergence insufficiency is best treated by a combination of in-office vision therapy exercises and at-home reinforcement exercises.\n<!--more-->\nAs a result of eye doctors throughout the country failing to support what <a href="http://convergenceinsufficiency.net/uploads/CITT_Arch_2008.pdf" target="_blank">the current science suggests</a>, convergence insufficiency remains a relatively unknown disorder. However, just because it’s unknown doesn’t mean it’s uncommon. <strong>1 in 12</strong> people suffer from this disorder, and all of the symptoms associated with it:\n<ul>\n	<li>Headaches with reading or during close work</li>\n	<li>Loss of attention and concentration for reading or during close work</li>\n	<li>Words moving or doubling when reading or during close work</li>\n	<li>Eye fatigue and/or discomfort with reading or during close work</li>\n	<li>Homework battles: 20 minutes of homework takes hours</li>\n</ul>\nIt’s unfortunate that these individuals are far more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD or ADD rather than convergence insufficiency. With Ritalin and Adderall shortages occurring more and more frequently, you would think that this issue would be gaining more attention, if for no other reason than as a possible underlying cause of the spike in ADHD and ADD diagnoses. No such luck.\n\nIn a study done by Dr. Davis B. Granet with 266 patients with CI (convergence insufficiency), there is “an apparent three-fold greater incidence of ADHD among patients with CI when compared with the incidence of ADHD in the general US population (1.8-3.3%) (Leslie et al., 2004). We also note a seeming three-fold greater incidence of CI in the ADHD population. This may simply represent an association and not be a causative relationship.

Two vision disorders which affect visual tracking, an important skill in many sports, are amblyopia and strabismus.\n\nStrabismus occurs when the two eyes do not physically fixate on the same point, resulting in one eye appearing to be “turned” out, in, up or down. The two disorders can occur simultaneously, with strabismus being the cause of amblyopia (known as strabismic amblyopia). However, the presence of strabismus does not imply the presence of amblyopia, and vice versa. Sometimes, even if a child suffers from strabismus, it may be that the eye turn is so small that it is not noticeable by a visual examination.\n\nWhile strabismus describes a physical “eye turn,” amblyopia describes the condition where the brain suppresses or ignores information coming from one eye, resulting in uneven visual acuity and, in extreme cases, blindness in one eye. Either disorder can negatively impact stereoscopy, or the ability to see in three dimensions. Without stereoscopy, depth perception and hand-eye coordination suffer in a sports setting.\n\nIssues in visual acuity are often the first vision problems to be noticed by parents, as “20/20” acuity screenings are often part of a sport physical and are occasionally required by the school for all students. However, when there still seems to be a visual problem in the child, even after testing yields a “20/20” result or the proper lenses are prescribed, a vision disorder should be your next suspect.

For a child, that field is reduced to just 2-3 inches. For a young adult the field is about at 4-6 inches, and for an 80-year-old? 60 inches. The greatest change in accommodation amplitude seems to occur between the third and fifth decade of life.\n\nAs we age, our lenses lose elasticity, and thus, we are unable to focus on near field objects as clearly as we when we were young. Tasks such as threading a needle or reading label ingredients on personal care products or food cartons become next to impossible without magnifying glasses.\n\nTo test for near field accommodation, schedule an appointment with Dr. Tod Davis Developmental Optometry & Vision Therapy Services.

They are among babies born with anisometropia. That means there is a large disparity between the two eyes in visual acuity. It also usually means the child will develop amblyopia, or lazy eye, in the first five years of life. One and one-half percent of the babies born each year come into the world with both anisometropia and amblyopia. The more severe the difference in vision between the eyes, the more likely it is that amblyopia, if not already present, will surface.\n\nSome anisometropics are nearsighted in one eye and farsighted in the other, creating an entirely different set of challenges, but in most cases both eyes are either far or nearsighted, with the vision in one eye being quite good, and the other being quite poor. Depth perception, hand-eye coordination, and other vision problems can result from this inequality of vision.\n\nWith such a large refractive error, it is likely that vision will be impacted by accommodation, the process by which the brain receives visual communication from the stronger eye while ignoring the blurry images from the weaker eye. The longer the process continues, the weaker the eye with poor vision gets, until, in some cases, there is complete vision loss in that eye.\n\nTreatment is usually centered on corrective lenses.

Some are born with the condition. Others acquire it through diseases like MS, brain tumors, diabetes, or head injuries. Others may experience the condition as a side effect from prescription medicine. Some experience nystagmus caused by nicotine, bright light flashes, hyperventilation, or deep vibration.\n\nThere are two types of nystagmus. Optokinetic nystagmus is caused within the eye, whereas vestibular nystagmus stems from the inner ear. Inner ear problems may cause jerk nystagmus, where the eyes move slowly in one direction, then jerk back across the visual field, which can cause vertigo as well as nausea. The condition improves with age, but worsens as one tires.\n\nThere is one other cause for nystagmus, however: inebriation. If an individual is drunk, their eyes will dance if they attempt to fix their gaze to the extreme left or right. This was discovered by a vision therapist, and the discovery has led to the development of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, frequently used in field sobriety tests by police officers today.\n\nThere are surgical procedures that seem to help with hereditary nystagmus. Additional treatments include botox, although with temporary results, and biofeedback therapy. Corrective lenses can improve vision for those with nystagmus.\n\nSurgery, drugs, and even acupuncture have been shown to be effective treatments for nystagmus, in addition to recent pharmaceutical discoveries that help smooth the eye movements.

The problem is this: Despite randomized controlled trials, or RCTs, which demonstrate the effectiveness of vision therapy for the treatment of convergence insufficiency, many eye doctors still fail to test for the disorder. Some even going so far as to dismiss the efficacy of vision therapy. The Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (or CITT) conclusively demonstrates that convergence insufficiency is best treated by a combination of in-office vision therapy exercises and at-home reinforcement exercises.\n\nAs a result of eye doctors throughout the country failing to support what the current science suggests, convergence insufficiency remains a relatively unknown disorder. However, just because it’s unknown doesn’t mean it’s uncommon. 1 in 12 people suffer from this disorder, and all of the symptoms associated with it:\n\n    Headaches with reading or during close work\n    Loss of attention and concentration for reading or during close work\n    Words moving or doubling when reading or during close work\n    Eye fatigue and/or discomfort with reading or during close work\n    Homework battles: 20 minutes of homework takes hours\n\nIt’s unfortunate that these individuals are far more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD or ADD rather than convergence insufficiency. With Ritalin and Adderall shortages occurring more and more frequently, you would think that this issue would be gaining more attention, if for no other reason than as a possible underlying cause of the spike in ADHD and ADD diagnoses. No such luck.\n\nIn a study done by Dr. Davis B. Granet with 266 patients with CI (convergence insufficiency), there is “an apparent three-fold greater incidence of ADHD among patients with CI when compared with the incidence of ADHD in the general US population (1.8-3.3%) (Leslie et al., 2004). We also note a seeming three-fold greater incidence of CI in the ADHD population. This may simply represent an association and not be a causative relationship. Until further studies are performed, however, patients diagnosed with ADHD should be evaluated to identify the small subset that may have CI – a condition that responds well to treatment at home.”\n\nWe work hard to raise awareness about the vision disorders which are so often ignored, and to treat those who are suffering from such disorders. Our goal is to always be one of the “Bright Spots” which the VisionHelp Blog describes. If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD or ADD, but has not had a thorough vision screening by a developmental eye doctor, you may be treating the symptoms when it is possible to treat the cause: Vision therapy has been proven to treat convergence insufficiency, and may be able to help your child focus without the use of medications.\n\nSee “The Relationship Between Convergence Insufficiency and ADHD” by Dr. David B.

The freedom of summer was just around the bend, and they eagerly looked forward to the break. However, once they’ve had their fill of summer, these same children begin to anticipate school: They are entering a new grade, perhaps a new school. For some children, buying school supplies and perhaps even new school outfits can be exciting and escalate their desire to return to learn new studies.\n\nYet there are some children who dread going back to school. There are a wide variety of reasons for this, and for some of those kids it’s their struggle with academics. Namely, the struggle with homework, or seeing the board clearly, or reading correctly out loud in class, makes many tummies upset. Perhaps it’s the headaches that make children begin to dread going to class, their eyes getting tired halfway through the day. For some children it’s even their sports abilities – who really enjoys looking like a fool on the field?\n\nAugust is National Vision & Learning Month, and as part of that, we here at Developmental Optometry & Vision Therapy Services want to put out a reminder that having 20/20 eyesight does not mean that there are no vision issues. In fact, it has been proven that children can have “perfect eyesight” and yet continue to experience vision disorders that make their school life miserable.\n\nVision disorders include things like the better-known lazy eye, but it also includes problems like convergence insufficiency and amblyopia, to name a few. Many learning-related vision disorders can manifest themselves in children as symptoms that may not initially appear to be vision-caused. In fact, in some kids it can appear as ADD or ADHD symptoms, including: failure to give close attention to details, failure to listen when spoken to directly, frequently misplacing items, forgetfulness in daily activities, easily distracted, and difficulty remaining seated.\n\nIn a study done by Dr. Davis B.

Then the dreaded “cost” issue comes up.\n\nThe first question that probably comes to your mind is, “Does my health insurance cover this?” Unfortunately, many health insurance companies refuse to cover vision therapy, especially if the therapy appears to be “non-medical” in what it’s addressing. This can be especially frustrating if your health insurance covers other kinds of therapy.\n\nOn top of this, truly effective vision therapy requires a one-on-one therapist with at-home exercises, which can increase the cost versus a computerized vision therapy regimen or completely at-home exercises, which research has shown to be no more effective than a placebo.\n\nSo what are you to do? Your child obviously shows signs of vision disorders, and more than likely your son or daughter’s enjoyment of life, school, learning, and even sports has been negatively affected by their struggles with their vision. Yet the sheer cost of vision therapy is enough to make people balk.\n\nOftentimes, we like to point out to those that are this stage, that vision therapy can be related to braces. Health insurance doesn’t cover all of the cost of braces for most people. And yet people simply put priority on getting their child braces and make it happen financially. Although for some people braces are to address a painful or upcoming issue, many people get braces for purely cosmetic reasons.\n\nKeeping in mind that vision therapy affects multiple facets of your ability to read, retain, and process information, and even in day-to-day life in areas of balance and the ability to measure depth and distance in our three-dimensional world, how much more important is vision therapy compared to a cosmetic reason? We’re not here to say you should pick vision therapy over braces – please, by no means think that – but sometimes we find that people’s priorities for their child’s or even their own are skewed to think that vision therapy is not that important.\n\nWe not just trying to sell you on this, either; we perform our jobs eagerly to see our patients’ eyes light up as they realize they no longer see everything doubled up, or words stop blurring, or they can pitch, catch, and bat a baseball, or they stop bumping into corners, or they’re able to sit down and learn when before it was too tiring and caused a headache. The increased confidence, the relief as their struggle to learn is removed, and the smiles are why we do what we do.\n\nNow, this doesn’t remove the obstacle of cost, especially if your health insurance won’t help. We here at Developmental Optometry & Vision Therapy Services know you have a family to feed, a mortgage to pay, cars to maintain, and lives to live.

Davis responds to “High-Performance Vision Training Improves Batting Statistics for University of Cincinnati Baseball Players”\n\nA common response from parents after vision therapy is that their child’s sports ability increases. “Thomas has played in baseball since he was six,” says Nancy M., Thomas’ grandmother. “However, it wasn’t until after vision therapy that Thomas, who had convergence insufficiency and eye-tracking issues, went from often missing the ball by three inches to hitting, catching, and pitching with amazing accuracy!” Not only do academic abilities improve with vision therapy, but on-the-field improvements occur as well. Vision therapy allows for better tracking, better depth perception, better balance, better hand-eye coordination, and even better response time because the visual system has been trained to register faster.\n\nWe’ve had numerous referrals from families with stories that go like this: George goes through a year of vision therapy, and the next year joins the same sports team he was in last year, say baseball, with his friend Johnny. Johnny’s parents are so impressed with George’s improved performance compared to the previous year that they ask George’s parents what sports camp they put George through. George’s parents simply reply, “We didn’t. George had vision therapy.” So, Johnny’s parents investigate vision therapy, and decide they want vision therapy for Johnny too – not because he’s showing obvious signs of a vision disorder, but because they have seen the results of what training the eyes to work with the brain-to-hand motion can do for a child.\n\nOn a national level, over the last several years, there has been more attention given to the benefits of vision therapy for athletes. There was an article in the Washington Times on June 13th titled “Eyes Have It With Help of Special Spectacles,” in which several players on the Washington National’s team are using the Nike Strobe glasses, another method of vision therapy. (We actually will be providing these through the office for those that are interested.) This has been the norm with most sports teams, where a few select players on a team receive vision therapy.\n\nThis particular article titled “High Performance Vision Training Improves Batting Statistics for University of Cincinnati Baseball Players” that I am responding to, however, is unusual in that the whole-team participated. The team’s batting average – the team, not a single player – “increased from 0.251 in 2010 to 0.285 in 2011 and the slugging percentage increased by 0.033. The rest of the Big East’s slugging percentage fell over that same time frame 0.082.” For those not familiar with baseball, this is huge, especially for an entire team’s batting average.\n\nI suspect that vision therapy – eye vision training – is going to become more integrated into sports and sports training for both children, as well as adults in the upcoming years, and I think this article speaks towards that.\n\n“<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029109 " target="_blank">High-Performance Vision Training Improves Batting Statistics for University of Cincinnati Baseball Players</a>” by Joseph F.

Here are some of those questions:\n\n<strong>Does Hair Obstruct Vision Totally?</strong>\n\nFor the claim that hair in your eyes causes vision problems to hold much water, it would have to be demonstrable that the presence of hair over one’s eye obscures vision from that eye just as much as would wearing an eye patch. We suppose that this is theoretically possible, but would require a particularly thick volume of hair over that eye. Such a thick lock would probably not be kept over the eye, however, as it would rob the person of their ability to see depth effectively. If the wearer of such a hairstyle were involved in any sports, they would quickly see the need for keeping this amount of hair out of their eyes. This leads directly into our next question:\n\n<strong>What is the Minimum Duration of Obstruction before Losing Vision?</strong>\n\nSince we can surmise that an athlete would always keep their theoretically single-eye-blinding hair out of their eyes during a sporting event, we’ll pretend this is a non-athlete. We know that patching is used as part of lazy eye treatments, and is particularly effective against refractive amblyopia. However, even the best-case treatment requires patching for at least 2 – 8 hours per day for 3 months or longer, and this period of patching should be consecutive for best results.\n\nWe also know that the vision in the non-lazy eye tends to recover quickly after patching. Thus, for hair obstruction of vision to work the other way and cause vision loss would require more consecutive obstruction for a longer period of time. Let’s pretend that this would happen at 10 hours per day over the course of one year. Now we have to ask just one more question.\n<strong>\nWhat is the Likelihood of a “Hair Flip” Occurring During those 10 Hours?</strong>\n\nThink about it. Better yet, look at the picture on the link above. Justin Bieber’s hair is out of his eyes for that picture. How frequently does one specifically move their hair out of their eyes, either for pictures or because their hair is annoying them in its present position? It is highly unlikely that someone would willingly leave their hair in their eyes for 10 hours at one time. In fact, it would take a rather conscious effort by them to not move their hair (or do any activity which might move their hair) for their hair to, in fact, stay put for 10 hours on end.\n\nRemember, this is assuming that the hair caused a perfect obstruction akin to an eye patch. Anything which did not cause this obstruction would most certainly not cause the vision of an eye to become blurry (though it certainly might obstruct vision). Perhaps the Australian ophthalmologist will someday develop some research which demonstrates by what mechanism thick bangs can cause vision loss, but with what we currently know about the eye, vision and vision disorders, this hardly seems plausible.', 'Can Long Bangs Cause Lazy Eye?

However, with symptoms that often are similar to each other, vision disorders in children may sometimes be misdiagnosed as ADHD.\n\nConvergence insufficiency is a common visual disorder which affects the coordination of the eyes. An estimated 1 in 20 children suffer from convergence insufficiency. But, what is convergence insufficiency? First, let me explain the concept of convergence: When reading, writing, drawing, or doing other work that requires up-close attention, a person’s eyes must turn in, or converge, in order for the image of the work to be clear.\n\nConvergence happens smoothly and subconsciously in those without convergence insufficiency. However, those who suffer from the disorder have difficulty turning their eyes inward. As a result, conscious effort must be made to focus on close objects, which is very tiring.\n\nHave you ever crossed your eyes? Imagine feeling like you had to do that in order to read, and imagine being expected to maintain that focus for minutes or even hours at a time. This is how reading feels to those with convergence insufficiency. It’s no wonder they have difficulty focusing on their work!\n\nThis extra exertion, naturally, causes a number of uncomfortable symptoms, such as eyestrain, headaches and blurred vision. Children with convergence insufficiency may experience difficulty concentrating, read slowly, read the same line repeatedly, have trouble remembering what they read, or frequently lose their place. This may result in inattentiveness at school and while completing homework, or a general avoidance of such close work.\n\nHere’s the problem: To a parent, or even a medical practitioner, all of these symptoms suggest ADHD. Those with convergence insufficiency may even have 20/20 vision, further complicating diagnoses. In a 2000 study, it was demonstrated that children diagnosed with ADHD are three times more likely to have convergence insufficiency than children who have not been so diagnosed. Clearly, there is reason to believe that some of those children would not need ADHD medications if their struggle with convergence insufficiency was to be fully addressed and treated.\n\nThis is why we recommend the following: If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, or is exhibiting some of the signs of convergence insufficiency or ADHD, a thorough developmental vision exam by a developmental optometrist should be your first step in treating the disorder. It’s a decision that could save your child the stigma of being diagnosed with ADHD, and save you money on medications.', 'How Convergence Insufficiency Can Sometimes Act Like ADHD', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-convergence-insufficiency-can-sometimes-act-like-adhd-2', '', '', '2014-01-04 03:49:02', '2014-01-04 03:49:02', '', 0, 'http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/?p=409', 0, 'post', '', 2),

A child may not necessarily be exhibiting signs of a learning issue (such as fussing over homework or showing a slower progression among their classmates) in order for a vision disorder to be present. Even children who are otherwise gifted learners can still suffer from vision disorders. Therefore, convergence insufficiency, amblyopia, and other disorders of vision are not and should not be attributed only to “slow learners” or “reluctant readers.”\n\nDifficulty learning is usually the sign of a vision problem that most parents pay attention to. Because of this, it is often the case that an intelligent child is not brought in for diagnosis until their academic performance suffers. At this point, the parents are often confused by the child’s struggles in certain areas. The parents may even mistake the reduced performance, such as on a written test, as a sign of laziness in the child. These children are often performing adequately enough to not qualify for additional in-school help, which can reinforce this assumption.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the gifted child may otherwise be extremely verbal, and do perfectly on verbal tests. In fact, he or she may be able to answer questions on a written test correctly when asked them verbally. When there is a disparity such as this, seeking a thorough vision screening should be a parent’s immediate reaction. A functional vision test goes far beyond the “20/20” eye chart examination with which we are all so familiar. This vision assessment tests the full range visual health factors, including eye tracking, eye teaming and convergence. By testing all aspects of vision, this screening uncovers vision disorders such as convergence insufficiency, amblyopia, eye-teaming issues and computer vision syndrome.\n\nWhen such disorders come to light, the good news is that they are often treatable without surgery or glasses. Vision therapy, a series of exercises meant to re-train the eyes to function according to their intended function, corrects a wide variety of vision disorders.

When there is great disparity in acuity between refractive errors of the eyes, the stronger eye often takes over, effectively erasing the visual information sent from the weaker eye. Eventually, refractive amblyopia finds one eye doing most or all of the work, while the other eye does nothing. <!--more-->\n\nIn strabismic amblyopia, one or both eyes are turned, creating two separate sets of visual information resulting in double vision. The brain turns off the information from one eye to avoid seeing double, leaving the other eye without a task. It is possible, over time, to completely lose sight in the weaker or lazy eye.\n\nTreatment of amblyopia usually involves disabling the stronger eye in some way, either patching, drops, or a contact lens, forcing the weaker eye to gradually strengthen and learn to function. Sometimes, a program of disabling is coupled with surgery to physically correct a turned eye. While that presents a cosmetic solution to the problem, the weaker eye still has not been trained to work, and will likely continue to remain weak even though aesthetically normal. \n\nIt was once thought that only children under the age of six could be treated for amblyopia, however, many adults that grew up without the benefit of treatment have undergone a successful program of visual therapy, experiencing highly successful results from combinations of glasses, patching or disabling, and vision therapy. Stories of people well into their 50s and 60s finally achieving binocular vision through vision therapy programs are well documented. \n\nExperienced developmental ophthalmologists and developmental optometrists, like Dr. Tod Davis, can work with a variety of patients experiencing a broad range of amblyopic conditions, applying over 35 years of experience to the task for successful treatment.

Some of that change we have no direct control over like aging, disease and injury. With age, disease and injury we can reduce our susceptibility with reasonable measures, such as diet, exercise, and safety awareness. Then there is the change in our minds that we can directly control through challenging exercises that confront our minds with a certain level of difficulty and repetitive engagement.\n\n	This relates to what is called brain plasticity (neuroplasticity), which is now widely accepted in the neurosciences and described in the book “Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain”, by Sharon Begley. Her book describes neuroplasticity as the ability of the brain to change in response to experience, revealing that the brain is capable of altering its structure and function. The brain can even generate new neurons, a power we retain well into old age. So, feel free to change your mind at any time!\n\n	One aspect of “brain training” is Vision Therapy, a sequence of activities individually prescribed and monitored by a Developmental Optometrist. This type of therapy or brain training is designed to develop efficient visual skills and processing for individuals whose vision did not develop naturally, or who have experienced injury to the brain.  Many of these people experience a wide range of physical, academic and behavioral problems. In-office techniques utilize lenses, prisms, filters, and many other types of specialized equipment with corresponding home activities to reinforce developing visual skills.\n\n	Vision Therapy changes the brain, specifically the visual system, by engaging the brain in repetitive, challenging tasks. In turn, these activities enhance existing neural pathways or create new ones.  The key to successful vision therapy is the right amount of difficulty.  In the book “The Talent Code,” author Daniel Coyle describes how the nervous system reinforces neurons and neural connections through repetition and maintaining a level of difficulty at the edge of failure, which he described as deep practice.\n\n	Imagine a young girl rolling a soccer ball between her feet and trying to pop it up in the air in order to pass it to a team mate. She tries and fails repeatedly until she slows the process down and concentrates on simply rolling the ball onto her foot. In time she realizes the subtle movements needed to make the delicate pass. Now imagine our young soccer player repeating over and over the subtle maneuver with the ball until it becomes automatic and she is able to pass the ball to her teammate effortlessly. This is deep practice.<a href="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Little-Girl-Soccer.jpg"><img src="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Little-Girl-Soccer.jpg" alt="" title="Little Girl Soccer" width="300" height="267" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-535" /></a>\n\n	The concept of deep practice is central to most vision therapy procedures. Tasks begin at the level of difficulty needed to induce minor failures which cause the patient to become increasingly aware of how they are performing, in other words self-evaluation. Vision therapy patients begin self-correction at the point of failure. They explore the edge of their abilities and begin to develop the required visual and motor skills necessary to move forward. This is repeated over and over again until there are no more levels of difficulty to achieve. This process causes the nervous system to reinforce the needed neural pathways. Once these pathways are reinforced their use becomes automated and permanent.\n\n	Vision therapy is based on deep practice and the science of neuroplasticity. To learn more about vision therapy contact a developmental ophthalmologist or developmental optometrists, like Dr. Todd Davis and Dr. Amy Carlyle, Developmental Optometry - Vision Therapy – NeuroOptometry – Low Vision Services who can put over 30 years of experience to work for patients experiencing vision related issues.

Digital displays are everywhere. Computers and cell phones, highway signs and academic classrooms. Not seeing or processing images well can impact one''s opportunities adversely. \n\nIt is of the utmost importance, when a child exhibits signs of difficulty in reading and cognitive skills, as with dyslexia, to have a thorough evaluation done. Perfect 20/20 vision does not tell the whole story. Nor does a regular physical exam. It is only when the visual and neurological matrix is embraced as an interconnected whole, and all functions relating to visual performance are examined, that an appropriate plan for treatment and management can be derived. \n\nThe American Academy of Optometry and the American Optometric Association have developed a joint policy statement voicing the need for those at risk of cognitive or learning-related problems due to vision disorders to undergo a comprehensive vision exam including eye health along with eye function. A post-evaluation plan, including guidance for future treatment and referral to specialists, should make the assessment and recommendations known. \n\nThe group notes that there are three parts of vision that are integral to the learning process: the visual pathway, visual efficiency, and information processing. The visual pathway includes all of the structures of the eye and brain that contribute to the learning process. Visual efficiency embraces movement, accommodation, teaming, and focusing. Information processing includes spatial awareness, coordination of vision with touch, sound, and the other senses, as well as identification and discrimination.\n\nLike the visual process itself, dyslexia has a complex set of challenges that display acuity disorders in addition to processing and other physical errors. It is important to review all areas involved in cognitive tasks for academic work to truly assess a patient exhibiting dyslexic tendencies. \n\nEarly detection and treatment or management of vision disorders related to dyslexia is advised, keeping the patient as functional and as on schedule as possible in relation to peers. That said, however, it is never too late to seek help for an adult with dyslexia, as many older patients find they are able to develop skills through the help of a developmental optometrist that they never thought would be possible. \n\nVision therapy, sometimes thought to be connected with less effective treatment, is actually a proven, well-researched, and well-respected area of treatment for those suffering from vision disorders common to dyslexic individuals. Through use of exercises, lenses, and prisms patients are able to function as close to their goals as possible, enjoying academic pursuits and careers that would otherwise not be possible.\n\nDr. Tod Davis has treated patients with dyslexia for over 25 years, putting his expertise and experience to work creating programs that give patients the tools to succeed.

Or do you see with your brain? \n\nThe words on this page would be meaningless without interpretation by the brain. Likewise, beautiful images would be lost in translation without input from photoreceptive rods and cones in the retina. Vision, as we commonly refer to it, is a collaborative process engaging both eye and brain to fully enjoy a breathtaking sunset, or comprehend the writings of Shakespeare. \n\nWhen the brain suffers injury, either from trauma or stroke, the damage done to vision often takes three forms: visual field loss, diplopia (double vision), and/or visual balance disorders. \n\nVisual field loss often reduces a patient to central vision, making images and objects in the peripheral field invisible. Such limitations can prove dangerous for patients, as they navigate without the benefit of seeing moving vehicles, obstructions, or pitfalls outside of their present range. \n\nDiplopia often causes a patient to begin ignoring messages from the weaker eye in order to eliminate dizzying double images. Diplopia makes reading and close, intricate tasks, such as threading a needle or signing a document, both uncomfortable and frustrating. If left untreated, the weaker eye can eventually lose all capacity for sight.\n\nVisual balance disorders, such as Midline Shift Disorder and/or visual neglect/imperceptions, can be especially troubling to brain injury patients.  Midline Shift Disorder moves the perception of an individual’s center line causing them to potentially lose their balance or misjudge their relation to an object.  Visual imperception disrupts the patient’s perception of where they are in space, putting them at risk of anything harmful in the neglected visual area.\n\n<a href="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/thCAP40BH2.jpg"><img src="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/thCAP40BH2.jpg" alt="" title="Vision Therapy" width="369" height="314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-554" /></a><a \n\nVision therapy can improve many of the vision disorders associated with brain injuries. Developmental optometrists and developmental ophthalmologists can help patients by prescribing individualized vision therapy programs that improve a patient’s ability to determine their “place in space.” Behavioral and developmental optometrists understand how the eye and brain work together, and know how to test for specific vision disorders. Once tested, doctors like Dr. Tod Davis are able to design vision therapy programs that offer accommodative behaviors to decrease the likelihood of accidents caused by vision disorders, as well as design physical activities to strengthen skills. \n\nWhile every patient is different, experienced developmental optometrists have a library of therapeutic exercises and tools that can offer brain injured patients improved lifestyles through improved vision and perception skills. Dr. Tod Davis Developmental Optometry and Vision Therapy Services has been helping patients in a clinical setting for more than 25 years, developing exercises and lens combinations to help brain injured patients see the world in the best possible light.

Unfortunately for Mike, in the real world he would never enjoy the capability of binocular vision. Interestingly, having two eyes isn’t enough for binocular vision to occur.\n\nHuman eyes are designed to work as a team, both looking in the same direction at the same focal point, and returning similar images that the brain and visual system combine into one, stereoscopic, binocular view. \n\nBinocular vision is important in developing good depth perception, which in turn affects coordination and hand to eye skills. Without binocular vision, catching a baseball, making sense of classroom instructions on a blackboard or screen, and performing simple tasks such as walking or running becomes difficult. Those with impaired binocular vision often appear clumsy and uncoordinated because they lack the ability to orient themselves with relation to their environment.\n\nOne cause of poor binocular vision is eye alignment. The eyes, as described above, are not looking in the same direction. It is estimated that 3 percent of the population suffers from such issues. Another cause of poor binocular vision is a dramatic difference in acuity between the two eyes, with one eye seeing quite well and the other with a severe acuity issue. It is thought that as high as 12 percent of the population has binocular vision impairment.\n\nSuch vision disorders are sometimes missed in regular eye examinations. Should you suspect a binocular vision problem or another vision disorder, schedule and examination by a developmental optometrist, trained to diagnose and treat these conditions.

Understanding how movement effects on our developing vision is important to understanding the developmental foundation of Vision Therapy.\n\nPrimitive reflexes are automated movements that are not initiated by conscious thought. They are a part of a child''s pre and postnatal development. Primitive reflexes are necessary for initiating specific movements during delivery and afterward for infant safety and survival. This is why they have been referred to as "primitive" reflexes. In ideal infant and child development the primitive reflexes fade, or become integrated, as the child develops more sophisticated sensory and motor functions. However, in some children they do not become integrated and persist.\n\n<a href="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Catch.jpg"><img src="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Catch.jpg" alt="" title="Catch" width="193" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-608" /></a>\n\nImagine a five year old child trying to catch a rubber ball and consistently missing the ball by trying to wrap their arms around it rather than using their hands to catch it. This often happens in children who do not integrate a reflex called symmetrical tonic neck reflex (STNR). This particular reflex is useful to an infant up to eight months and aides in crawling, a major developmental milestone. In this scenario, the reflex which initially aided in the child’s development has become a road block to optimal development by preventing the intended movements of the child when trying to catch a ball.\n\nVision develops in predictable stages and is predicated on a child’s movements; whether reaching for an object or moving their entire body in a given direction. It begins with the child putting things to his or her mouth to determine size, shape and density. As the child matures he or she will begin to use their hands to explore objects and the environment. Eventually the experiences with the mouth and hands will equip a child with a substantial understanding of their environment and the objects in it so that they can rely on the use of their eyes to determine size, shape, location and spatial awareness of things.\n\nPhysical and cognitive development is based on our ability to move in our environments and experience and manipulate objects and information. Anything preventing the child’s conscious or intended movements also prevents that child’s exploration and eventual understanding of their environment. Unconscious movement patterns delay and sometimes prevent physical and cognitive development, which inhibits normal development of the visual system and leads to many learning challenges.\n\nMany of the problems associated with retained primitive reflexes or limited movement during key stages of development include poor balance, low muscle tone, poor body awareness, poor eye movement control, orientation, and reduced cognitive abilities. This is why the building of core muscle strength is a crucial part of vision therapy activities. Abdominal crunches not only build a foundation for good muscle tone, but an improved ability to move one’s body and the development of vision.\n\nFortunately, primitive reflexes can be integrated through specific repetitive movement patterns. Vision Therapy includes activities to incorporate primitive reflexes and improve a child’s conscious movement in their environment. These therapeutic activities are designed to either counter or mimic the reflexive movement with an emphasis on conscious muscular control by the child. Therapy involves the repetition of these specific movements to guide the child through basic physical skills (body mechanics) to body awareness (left and right, upper and lower body, and coordination). These therapies result in the child’s conscious awareness and control of their body.  The integration of the primitive reflexes leads to intended motor control and increased visual development.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns related to primitive reflexes and their effect on your child’s visual development contact a developmental optometrists, like Dr. Todd Davis and Dr. Amy Carlyle, Developmental Optometry - Vision Therapy.

Visual fixation is the neuromuscular aiming of the eyes at a specific point in space. You can easily understand the need for fixation when you imagine someone involved in detailed work, like threading a needle, or sporting activities, such as throwing a baseball. According to many researchers fixation is determined by three basic factors; salience of the visual stimulus, memory or importance of the stimulus, and the nature of an activity we are engaged in.\n<a href="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/thCAXVEHTK1.jpg"><img src="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/thCAXVEHTK1.jpg" alt="" title="thCAXVEHTK" width="292" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-619" /></a>Whether we fixate on one thing or another can depend on the salience of the stimulus, or how prominent something is in the environment (like bright balloons). Color, illumination, contrast, and patterns determine how people perceive the prominence of something in their environment. Advertisers take advantage of this by presenting consumer products in a very particular way so that their product is prominently displayed with dramatic lighting and surrounding colors.\nHave you ever stared at something unknowingly for a several seconds until you realized the thing that caught your attention had actually triggered a memory or sequence of memories? Before you know it, you’ve been staring at it for several minutes. Recognition, memory and familiarity are prominent aspects of fixation. How well we fixate on an object or scene is dependent on if the object or aspects of the scene are interesting, contrasting, or familiar to us in some way.\nClearly some tasks are more important than others; driving versus watching television for instance. Safe driving requires one’s full attention and will demand fixation on the road ahead or other cars nearby. This is why the use of electronic devices, like a phone or music player, while driving is so dangerous. Watching television can be a very passive activity and does not require we completely fixate on what’s happening. The nature of a particular task can override what we fixate on whether something in our environment has salience, prominence or is memorable or familiar to us.

The actual medical term is Amblyopia.  It’s not an eye problem, it’s a problem where the brain ignores visual images from one eye due to a variety of vision disorders that cause double or blurred vision. The eye is not “lazy”, the brain is simply eliminating conflicting visual information by ignoring one of the images.\n\nTo look through a pair of amblyopic eyes is challenging. Things are unclear. Shadows are hazy. Highlights and details are gone and colors are less vivid. One amblyopic patient describes looking at the world through her amblyopic eye is like holding her breath, or not scratching an itch, desperately wanting to open the stronger eye to let it take over.\n\nTracking while reading can be very difficult with an amblyopic eye, as lines of type become wavy and even develop motion, causing the reader to lose track of progress. It also makes things go pretty slow, struggling to pay attention and interpret each and every word as it dances and fades.\n\nWhen letters appear in a crowd, such as a word-find puzzle, people with amblyopia have difficulty seeing individual letters as opposed to one big mass of marks. Letters in the middle of the puzzle blur and blend into each other. Identifying letters becomes as difficult as counting grains of rice spilled on the floor from a standing position. Hard to determine which grains you’ve already counted, right? \n\nThere is a good amblyopia simulation for those wanting to experience what an amblyopia sufferer might experience. In a normally-lit room, put a patch on one eye, or just cover it with your hand, for two to five minutes.

The covered eye has adjusted to the dark conditions, and will see pretty well, but the uncovered eye will not see very well, experiencing a disadvantage.

When sorting out the details of coverage for vision therapy, the route to successful insurance conclusions is pretty simple if you know what questions to ask, and figure out a plan with input from your vision care provider and your insurance agent.\n\nMost patients will find that initial comprehensive exams are covered. Many policies will also cover an additional exam to evaluate a patient’s visual information processing to determine an appropriate treatment program. That doesn’t mean yours will, however, so please make sure to check with your agent regarding your particular policy.\n\nSome insurance companies offer coverage for vision therapy, but just because they offer it does not mean that your policy includes it. A conversation with your insurance agent or workplace HR department can help you determine what will be covered. Toward that end, there are some important questions to ask that will help in the planning stages of therapy:\n\n•	Ask if vision therapy is covered, sometimes referred to as orthoptics in the insurance industry. If coverage is a part of your plan, it might also be smart to ask if there is an annual limit, or lifetime limit, for coverage. Note that vision therapy is most often applied to a medical policy as opposed to a vision policy.\n•	Ask which CPT insurance billing codes are covered under your policy with regard to vision therapy. Most therapy providers use code numbers 99203, 99204, and 92015 to bill for an initial vision exam of between 1 – 2 hours.

The actual medical term is Amblyopia.  It’s not an eye problem, it’s a problem where the brain ignores visual images from one eye due to a variety of vision disorders that cause double or blurred vision. The eye is not “lazy”, the brain is simply eliminating conflicting visual information by ignoring one of the images.\n\nTo look through a pair of amblyopic eyes is challenging. Things are unclear. Shadows are hazy. Highlights and details are gone and colors are less vivid. One amblyopic patient describes looking at the world through her amblyopic eye is like holding her breath, or not scratching an itch, desperately wanting to open the stronger eye to let it take over.\n\nTracking while reading can be very difficult with an amblyopic eye, as lines of type become wavy and even develop motion, causing the reader to lose track of progress. It also makes things go pretty slow, struggling to pay attention and interpret each and every word as it dances and fades.\n\nWhen letters appear in a crowd, such as a word-find puzzle, people with amblyopia have difficulty seeing individual letters as opposed to one big mass of marks. Letters in the middle of the puzzle blur and blend into each other. Identifying letters becomes as difficult as counting grains of rice spilled on the floor from a standing position. Hard to determine which grains you’ve already counted, right? \n\nThere is a good amblyopia simulation for those wanting to experience what an amblyopia sufferer might experience. In a normally-lit room, put a patch on one eye, or just cover it with your hand, for two to five minutes. Then, either have someone turn the lights out, or move to a darkened room and uncover your eye. The covered eye has adjusted to the dark conditions, and will see pretty well, but the uncovered eye will not see very well, experiencing a disadvantage. That disadvantage of that uncovered eye moving from light into dark is similar to the disadvantage experienced with amblyopia. Try it and “see” for yourself.\n\nDrs.

Reading for most children is a gateway to new information and a new understanding about the world around them. For many it is a fun and exciting adventure. For others it can be frustrating, lonely, disappointing, and confusing time, because words and numbers make no sense due to blurred vision or double-vision. Some of these children endure jokes and ridicule from peers over failure in the classroom. As well, they become defeated because they are unable to describe the problems they are facing. Many simply avoid reading or fight against it.\n\nIf you, or someone you know and love, falls into that second category, perhaps it is time for a thorough vision exam by a developmental optometrist. Many early reading problems can be associated with an undiscovered vision disorders, like convergence insufficiency or amblyiopia. Developmental Optometrists like Dr. Tod Davis are trained to recognize and treat vision problems with vision therapy. \n\nVision problems can be treated through lenses, exercises, and other vision therapy activities, to improve binocular function. Vision therapy programs designed by developmental optometrists can provide strategies and skills that help students reach academic milestones that once seemed out of reach. We have seen hundreds of once poor performers turn into dynamic achievers with new found confidence and passion for learning.\n\nHelping struggling students to achieve and succeed through vision therapy will not only improve academic progress, but will undoubtedly improve self image, a critical piece of the social scene in school. Early detection and treatment helps keep students aligned with peers, losing as little ground as possible. \n\nScheduling an appointment with a good developmental optometrist that understands the challenges many children face, and that can design a vision therapy program to engage the student, improve the skills, and gain confidence, is a priceless gift.

Visual fixation is the neuromuscular aiming of the eyes at a specific point in space. You can easily understand the need for fixation when you imagine someone involved in detailed work, like threading a needle, or sporting activities, such as throwing a baseball. According to many researchers fixation is determined by three basic factors; salience of the visual stimulus, memory or importance of the stimulus, and the nature of an activity we are engaged in.\n<a href="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/thCAXVEHTK1.jpg"><img src="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/thCAXVEHTK1.jpg" alt="" title="thCAXVEHTK" width="292" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-619" /></a>Whether we fixate on one thing or another can depend on the salience of the stimulus, or how prominent something is in the environment (like bright balloons). Color, illumination, contrast, and patterns determine how people perceive the prominence of something in their environment. Advertisers take advantage of this by presenting consumer products in a very particular way so that their product is prominently displayed with dramatic lighting and surrounding colors.\nHave you ever stared at something unknowingly for a several seconds until you realized the thing that caught your attention had actually triggered a memory or sequence of memories? Before you know it, you’ve been staring at it for several minutes. Recognition, memory and familiarity are prominent aspects of fixation. How well we fixate on an object or scene is dependent on if the object or aspects of the scene are interesting, contrasting, or familiar to us in some way.\nClearly some tasks are more important than others; driving versus watching television for instance. Safe driving requires one’s full attention and will demand fixation on the road ahead or other cars nearby. This is why the use of electronic devices, like a phone or music player, while driving is so dangerous. Watching television can be a very passive activity and does not require we completely fixate on what’s happening. The nature of a particular task can override what we fixate on whether something in our environment has salience, prominence or is memorable or familiar to us.

Convergence insufficiency, or the ability to sustain a focus on a letter or word, can be tricky. When children are just learning to read, things seem to go well at the beginning of a reading session, but deteriorate as the session continues. They can focus quickly but cannot sustain the focus and then begin to fail to recognize letters or make sense of words. Makes sense. If you cannot focus, it is very hard to read.<!--more-->\n\nReading requires pulling your eyes in, or converging them, to a focal point a short distance away. Looking up lets your eyes relax, allowing them to diverge at a distance far off on the horizon. Contracting muscles for convergence at close distances takes practice and work, yet still, some children are simply unable to sustain that close focus for long, experiencing convergence insufficiency. If they are unable to converge at all, then the more severe condition of convergence inability is at hand. \n\nBoth convergence insufficiency and convergence inability are vision disorders that can be treated with vision therapy. Normally developed as a child begins to crawl, the convergence distance changed and encouraged development of the skill every time he or she raised up and gazed around or looked down at the floor.

The Gardner test differentiates between types of reversals, further identifying a patient with dysponesia, dyseidesia, or dysnemkinesia. \n\nDysphonetics have difficulty integrating letters with sounds, and thus have a hard time sounding out words. Dyseidetics can sound out words, but have trouble with sequencing and find it tough to read an entire word at a time.

Understanding how movement effects on our developing vision is important to understanding the developmental foundation of Vision Therapy.\n\nPrimitive reflexes are automated movements that are not initiated by conscious thought. They are a part of a child''s pre and postnatal development. Primitive reflexes are necessary for initiating specific movements during delivery and afterward for infant safety and survival. This is why they have been referred to as "primitive" reflexes. In ideal infant and child development the primitive reflexes fade, or become integrated, as the child develops more sophisticated sensory and motor functions. However, in some children they do not become integrated and persist.\n\n<a href="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Catch.jpg"><img src="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Catch.jpg" alt="" title="Catch" width="193" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-608" /></a>\n\nImagine a five year old child trying to catch a rubber ball and consistently missing the ball by trying to wrap their arms around it rather than using their hands to catch it. This often happens in children who do not integrate a reflex called symmetrical tonic neck reflex (STNR). This particular reflex is useful to an infant up to eight months and aides in crawling, a major developmental milestone. In this scenario, the reflex which initially aided in the child’s development has become a road block to optimal development by preventing the intended movements of the child when trying to catch a ball.\n\nVision develops in predictable stages and is predicated on a child’s movements; whether reaching for an object or moving their entire body in a given direction. It begins with the child putting things to his or her mouth to determine size, shape and density. As the child matures he or she will begin to use their hands to explore objects and the environment. Eventually the experiences with the mouth and hands will equip a child with a substantial understanding of their environment and the objects in it so that they can rely on the use of their eyes to determine size, shape, location and spatial awareness of things.\n\nPhysical and cognitive development is based on our ability to move in our environments and experience and manipulate objects and information. Anything preventing the child’s conscious or intended movements also prevents that child’s exploration and eventual understanding of their environment. Unconscious movement patterns delay and sometimes prevent physical and cognitive development, which inhibits normal development of the visual system and leads to many learning challenges.\n\nMany of the problems associated with retained primitive reflexes or limited movement during key stages of development include poor balance, low muscle tone, poor body awareness, poor eye movement control, orientation, and reduced cognitive abilities. This is why the building of core muscle strength is a crucial part of vision therapy activities. Abdominal crunches not only build a foundation for good muscle tone, but an improved ability to move one’s body and the development of vision.\n\nFortunately, primitive reflexes can be integrated through specific repetitive movement patterns. Vision Therapy includes activities to incorporate primitive reflexes and improve a child’s conscious movement in their environment. These therapeutic activities are designed to either counter or mimic the reflexive movement with an emphasis on conscious muscular control by the child. Therapy involves the repetition of these specific movements to guide the child through basic physical skills (body mechanics) to body awareness (left and right, upper and lower body, and coordination). These therapies result in the child’s conscious awareness and control of their body.  The integration of the primitive reflexes leads to intended motor control and increased visual development.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns related to primitive reflexes and their effect on your child’s visual development contact a developmental optometrists, like Dr. Todd Davis and Dr. Amy Carlyle, Developmental Optometry - Vision Therapy. After a thorough screening and diagnosis they can craft a vision therapy program specifically designed to cultivate the most optimal and efficient visual system in your child, providing a more certain futur', '“What Does This Have To Do With My Vision!?” Movement and Vision Therapy', 'In Vision Therapy we often hear the following question from patients or their loved ones: “What does this have to do with vision?” They are referring to physical activities like building core muscle tone and integrating primitive reflexes.

Older children, as well as adults, can be successfully treated. Not only can, but should.

That window was believed to slam shut a few short years into childhood.\n\nFast forward a few decades, and research proved us wrong.

Unfortunately for Mike, in the real world he would never enjoy the capability of binocular vision. Interestingly, having two eyes isn’t enough for binocular vision to occur.\n\nHuman eyes are designed to work as a team, both looking in the same direction at the same focal point, and returning similar images that the brain and visual system combine into one, stereoscopic, binocular view. \n\nBinocular vision is important in developing good depth perception, which in turn affects coordination and hand to eye skills. Without binocular vision, catching a baseball, making sense of classroom instructions on a blackboard or screen, and performing simple tasks such as walking or running becomes difficult. Those with impaired binocular vision often appear clumsy and uncoordinated because they lack the ability to orient themselves with relation to their environment.\n\nOne cause of poor binocular vision is eye alignment. The eyes, as described above, are not looking in the same direction. It is estimated that 3 percent of the population suffers from such issues. Another cause of poor binocular vision is a dramatic difference in acuity between the two eyes, with one eye seeing quite well and the other with a severe acuity issue. It is thought that as high as 12 percent of the population has binocular vision impairment.\n\nSuch vision disorders are sometimes missed in regular eye examinations.

Or do you see with your brain? \n\nThe words on this page would be meaningless without interpretation by the brain. Likewise, beautiful images would be lost in translation without input from photoreceptive rods and cones in the retina. Vision, as we commonly refer to it, is a collaborative process engaging both eye and brain to fully enjoy a breathtaking sunset, or comprehend the writings of Shakespeare. \n\nWhen the brain suffers injury, either from trauma or stroke, the damage done to vision often takes three forms: visual field loss, diplopia (double vision), and/or visual balance disorders. \n\nVisual field loss often reduces a patient to central vision, making images and objects in the peripheral field invisible. Such limitations can prove dangerous for patients, as they navigate without the benefit of seeing moving vehicles, obstructions, or pitfalls outside of their present range. \n\nDiplopia often causes a patient to begin ignoring messages from the weaker eye in order to eliminate dizzying double images. Diplopia makes reading and close, intricate tasks, such as threading a needle or signing a document, both uncomfortable and frustrating. If left untreated, the weaker eye can eventually lose all capacity for sight.\n\nVisual balance disorders, such as Midline Shift Disorder and/or visual neglect/imperceptions, can be especially troubling to brain injury patients.  Midline Shift Disorder moves the perception of an individual’s center line causing them to potentially lose their balance or misjudge their relation to an object.  Visual imperception disrupts the patient’s perception of where they are in space, putting them at risk of anything harmful in the neglected visual area.\n\n<a href="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/thCAP40BH2.jpg"><img src="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/thCAP40BH2.jpg" alt="" title="Vision Therapy" width="369" height="314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-554" /></a><a \n\nVision therapy can improve many of the vision disorders associated with brain injuries. Developmental optometrists and developmental ophthalmologists can help patients by prescribing individualized vision therapy programs that improve a patient’s ability to determine their “place in space.” Behavioral and developmental optometrists understand how the eye and brain work together, and know how to test for specific vision disorders. Once tested, doctors like Dr. Tod Davis are able to design vision therapy programs that offer accommodative behaviors to decrease the likelihood of accidents caused by vision disorders, as well as design physical activities to strengthen skills. \n\nWhile every patient is different, experienced developmental optometrists have a library of therapeutic exercises and tools that can offer brain injured patients improved lifestyles through improved vision and perception skills.

Digital displays are everywhere. Computers and cell phones, highway signs and academic classrooms. Not seeing or processing images well can impact one''s opportunities adversely. \n\nIt is of the utmost importance, when a child exhibits signs of difficulty in reading and cognitive skills, as with dyslexia, to have a thorough evaluation done. Perfect 20/20 vision does not tell the whole story. Nor does a regular physical exam. It is only when the visual and neurological matrix is embraced as an interconnected whole, and all functions relating to visual performance are examined, that an appropriate plan for treatment and management can be derived. \n\nThe American Academy of Optometry and the American Optometric Association have developed a joint policy statement voicing the need for those at risk of cognitive or learning-related problems due to vision disorders to undergo a comprehensive vision exam including eye health along with eye function. A post-evaluation plan, including guidance for future treatment and referral to specialists, should make the assessment and recommendations known. \n\nThe group notes that there are three parts of vision that are integral to the learning process: the visual pathway, visual efficiency, and information processing. The visual pathway includes all of the structures of the eye and brain that contribute to the learning process. Visual efficiency embraces movement, accommodation, teaming, and focusing. Information processing includes spatial awareness, coordination of vision with touch, sound, and the other senses, as well as identification and discrimination.\n\nLike the visual process itself, dyslexia has a complex set of challenges that display acuity disorders in addition to processing and other physical errors. It is important to review all areas involved in cognitive tasks for academic work to truly assess a patient exhibiting dyslexic tendencies. \n\nEarly detection and treatment or management of vision disorders related to dyslexia is advised, keeping the patient as functional and as on schedule as possible in relation to peers. That said, however, it is never too late to seek help for an adult with dyslexia, as many older patients find they are able to develop skills through the help of a developmental optometrist that they never thought would be possible. \n\nVision therapy, sometimes thought to be connected with less effective treatment, is actually a proven, well-researched, and well-respected area of treatment for those suffering from vision disorders common to dyslexic individuals. Through use of exercises, lenses, and prisms patients are able to function as close to their goals as possible, enjoying academic pursuits and careers that would otherwise not be possible.\n\nDr. Tod Davis has treated patients with dyslexia for over 25 years, putting his expertise and experience to work creating programs that give patients the tools to succeed.

Some of that change we have no direct control over like aging, disease and injury. With age, disease and injury we can reduce our susceptibility with reasonable measures, such as diet, exercise, and safety awareness. Then there is the change in our minds that we can directly control through challenging exercises that confront our minds with a certain level of difficulty and repetitive engagement.\n\n	This relates to what is called brain plasticity (neuroplasticity), which is now widely accepted in the neurosciences and described in the book “Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain”, by Sharon Begley. Her book describes neuroplasticity as the ability of the brain to change in response to experience, revealing that the brain is capable of altering its structure and function. The brain can even generate new neurons, a power we retain well into old age. So, feel free to change your mind at any time!\n\n	One aspect of “brain training” is Vision Therapy, a sequence of activities individually prescribed and monitored by a Developmental Optometrist. This type of therapy or brain training is designed to develop efficient visual skills and processing for individuals whose vision did not develop naturally, or who have experienced injury to the brain.  Many of these people experience a wide range of physical, academic and behavioral problems. In-office techniques utilize lenses, prisms, filters, and many other types of specialized equipment with corresponding home activities to reinforce developing visual skills.\n\n	Vision Therapy changes the brain, specifically the visual system, by engaging the brain in repetitive, challenging tasks. In turn, these activities enhance existing neural pathways or create new ones.  The key to successful vision therapy is the right amount of difficulty.  In the book “The Talent Code,” author Daniel Coyle describes how the nervous system reinforces neurons and neural connections through repetition and maintaining a level of difficulty at the edge of failure, which he described as deep practice.\n\n	Imagine a young girl rolling a soccer ball between her feet and trying to pop it up in the air in order to pass it to a team mate. She tries and fails repeatedly until she slows the process down and concentrates on simply rolling the ball onto her foot. In time she realizes the subtle movements needed to make the delicate pass. Now imagine our young soccer player repeating over and over the subtle maneuver with the ball until it becomes automatic and she is able to pass the ball to her teammate effortlessly. This is deep practice.<a href="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Little-Girl-Soccer.jpg"><img src="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Little-Girl-Soccer.jpg" alt="" title="Little Girl Soccer" width="300" height="267" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-535" /></a>\n\n	The concept of deep practice is central to most vision therapy procedures. Tasks begin at the level of difficulty needed to induce minor failures which cause the patient to become increasingly aware of how they are performing, in other words self-evaluation. Vision therapy patients begin self-correction at the point of failure. They explore the edge of their abilities and begin to develop the required visual and motor skills necessary to move forward. This is repeated over and over again until there are no more levels of difficulty to achieve. This process causes the nervous system to reinforce the needed neural pathways. Once these pathways are reinforced their use becomes automated and permanent.\n\n	Vision therapy is based on deep practice and the science of neuroplasticity.

When there is great disparity in acuity between refractive errors of the eyes, the stronger eye often takes over, effectively erasing the visual information sent from the weaker eye. Eventually, refractive amblyopia finds one eye doing most or all of the work, while the other eye does nothing. <!--more-->\n\nIn strabismic amblyopia, one or both eyes are turned, creating two separate sets of visual information resulting in double vision. The brain turns off the information from one eye to avoid seeing double, leaving the other eye without a task. It is possible, over time, to completely lose sight in the weaker or lazy eye.\n\nTreatment of amblyopia usually involves disabling the stronger eye in some way, either patching, drops, or a contact lens, forcing the weaker eye to gradually strengthen and learn to function. Sometimes, a program of disabling is coupled with surgery to physically correct a turned eye. While that presents a cosmetic solution to the problem, the weaker eye still has not been trained to work, and will likely continue to remain weak even though aesthetically normal. \n\nIt was once thought that only children under the age of six could be treated for amblyopia, however, many adults that grew up without the benefit of treatment have undergone a successful program of visual therapy, experiencing highly successful results from combinations of glasses, patching or disabling, and vision therapy. Stories of people well into their 50s and 60s finally achieving binocular vision through vision therapy programs are well documented. \n\nExperienced developmental ophthalmologists and developmental optometrists, like Dr. Tod Davis, can work with a variety of patients experiencing a broad range of amblyopic conditions, applying over 35 years of experience to the task for successful treatment.

A child may not necessarily be exhibiting signs of a learning issue (such as fussing over homework or showing a slower progression among their classmates) in order for a vision disorder to be present. Even children who are otherwise gifted learners can still suffer from vision disorders. Therefore, convergence insufficiency, amblyopia, and other disorders of vision are not and should not be attributed only to “slow learners” or “reluctant readers.”\n\nDifficulty learning is usually the sign of a vision problem that most parents pay attention to. Because of this, it is often the case that an intelligent child is not brought in for diagnosis until their academic performance suffers. At this point, the parents are often confused by the child’s struggles in certain areas. The parents may even mistake the reduced performance, such as on a written test, as a sign of laziness in the child. These children are often performing adequately enough to not qualify for additional in-school help, which can reinforce this assumption.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the gifted child may otherwise be extremely verbal, and do perfectly on verbal tests. In fact, he or she may be able to answer questions on a written test correctly when asked them verbally. When there is a disparity such as this, seeking a thorough vision screening should be a parent’s immediate reaction. A functional vision test goes far beyond the “20/20” eye chart examination with which we are all so familiar. This vision assessment tests the full range visual health factors, including eye tracking, eye teaming and convergence. By testing all aspects of vision, this screening uncovers vision disorders such as convergence insufficiency, amblyopia, eye-teaming issues and computer vision syndrome.\n\nWhen such disorders come to light, the good news is that they are often treatable without surgery or glasses. Vision therapy, a series of exercises meant to re-train the eyes to function according to their intended function, corrects a wide variety of vision disorders. The result is that the child is better able to see and interpret written materials, allowing their natural giftedness to shine through all the more.', 'Gifted Children and Vision Disorders ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '412-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-01-04 03:46:12', '2014-01-04 03:46:12', '', 412, 'http://localhost/wordpress/davisvisiontherapy/?p=671', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

However, with symptoms that often are similar to each other, vision disorders in children may sometimes be misdiagnosed as ADHD.\n\nConvergence insufficiency is a common visual disorder which affects the coordination of the eyes. An estimated 1 in 20 children suffer from convergence insufficiency. But, what is convergence insufficiency? First, let me explain the concept of convergence: When reading, writing, drawing, or doing other work that requires up-close attention, a person’s eyes must turn in, or converge, in order for the image of the work to be clear.\n\nConvergence happens smoothly and subconsciously in those without convergence insufficiency. However, those who suffer from the disorder have difficulty turning their eyes inward. As a result, conscious effort must be made to focus on close objects, which is very tiring.\n\nHave you ever crossed your eyes? Imagine feeling like you had to do that in order to read, and imagine being expected to maintain that focus for minutes or even hours at a time. This is how reading feels to those with convergence insufficiency. It’s no wonder they have difficulty focusing on their work!\n\nThis extra exertion, naturally, causes a number of uncomfortable symptoms, such as eyestrain, headaches and blurred vision. Children with convergence insufficiency may experience difficulty concentrating, read slowly, read the same line repeatedly, have trouble remembering what they read, or frequently lose their place. This may result in inattentiveness at school and while completing homework, or a general avoidance of such close work.\n\nHere’s the problem: To a parent, or even a medical practitioner, all of these symptoms suggest ADHD. Those with convergence insufficiency may even have 20/20 vision, further complicating diagnoses. In a 2000 study, it was demonstrated that children diagnosed with ADHD are three times more likely to have convergence insufficiency than children who have not been so diagnosed. Clearly, there is reason to believe that some of those children would not need ADHD medications if their struggle with convergence insufficiency was to be fully addressed and treated.\n\nThis is why we recommend the following: If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, or is exhibiting some of the signs of convergence insufficiency or ADHD, a thorough developmental vision exam by a developmental optometrist should be your first step in treating the disorder. It’s a decision that could save your child the stigma of being diagnosed with ADHD, and save you money on medications.', 'How Convergence Insufficiency Can Sometimes Act Like ADHD', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '409-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-01-04 03:46:12', '2014-01-04 03:46:12', '', 409, 'http://localhost/wordpress/davisvisiontherapy/?p=672', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Here are some of those questions:\n\n<strong>Does Hair Obstruct Vision Totally?</strong>\n\nFor the claim that hair in your eyes causes vision problems to hold much water, it would have to be demonstrable that the presence of hair over one’s eye obscures vision from that eye just as much as would wearing an eye patch. We suppose that this is theoretically possible, but would require a particularly thick volume of hair over that eye. Such a thick lock would probably not be kept over the eye, however, as it would rob the person of their ability to see depth effectively. If the wearer of such a hairstyle were involved in any sports, they would quickly see the need for keeping this amount of hair out of their eyes. This leads directly into our next question:\n\n<strong>What is the Minimum Duration of Obstruction before Losing Vision?</strong>\n\nSince we can surmise that an athlete would always keep their theoretically single-eye-blinding hair out of their eyes during a sporting event, we’ll pretend this is a non-athlete. We know that patching is used as part of lazy eye treatments, and is particularly effective against refractive amblyopia. However, even the best-case treatment requires patching for at least 2 – 8 hours per day for 3 months or longer, and this period of patching should be consecutive for best results.\n\nWe also know that the vision in the non-lazy eye tends to recover quickly after patching. Thus, for hair obstruction of vision to work the other way and cause vision loss would require more consecutive obstruction for a longer period of time. Let’s pretend that this would happen at 10 hours per day over the course of one year. Now we have to ask just one more question.\n<strong>\nWhat is the Likelihood of a “Hair Flip” Occurring During those 10 Hours?</strong>\n\nThink about it. Better yet, look at the picture on the link above. Justin Bieber’s hair is out of his eyes for that picture. How frequently does one specifically move their hair out of their eyes, either for pictures or because their hair is annoying them in its present position? It is highly unlikely that someone would willingly leave their hair in their eyes for 10 hours at one time. In fact, it would take a rather conscious effort by them to not move their hair (or do any activity which might move their hair) for their hair to, in fact, stay put for 10 hours on end.\n\nRemember, this is assuming that the hair caused a perfect obstruction akin to an eye patch. Anything which did not cause this obstruction would most certainly not cause the vision of an eye to become blurry (though it certainly might obstruct vision). Perhaps the Australian ophthalmologist will someday develop some research which demonstrates by what mechanism thick bangs can cause vision loss, but with what we currently know about the eye, vision and vision disorders, this hardly seems plausible.', 'Can Long Bangs Cause Lazy Eye?

Davis responds to “High-Performance Vision Training Improves Batting Statistics for University of Cincinnati Baseball Players”\n\nA common response from parents after vision therapy is that their child’s sports ability increases. “Thomas has played in baseball since he was six,” says Nancy M., Thomas’ grandmother. “However, it wasn’t until after vision therapy that Thomas, who had convergence insufficiency and eye-tracking issues, went from often missing the ball by three inches to hitting, catching, and pitching with amazing accuracy!” Not only do academic abilities improve with vision therapy, but on-the-field improvements occur as well. Vision therapy allows for better tracking, better depth perception, better balance, better hand-eye coordination, and even better response time because the visual system has been trained to register faster.\n\nWe’ve had numerous referrals from families with stories that go like this: George goes through a year of vision therapy, and the next year joins the same sports team he was in last year, say baseball, with his friend Johnny. Johnny’s parents are so impressed with George’s improved performance compared to the previous year that they ask George’s parents what sports camp they put George through. George’s parents simply reply, “We didn’t. George had vision therapy.” So, Johnny’s parents investigate vision therapy, and decide they want vision therapy for Johnny too – not because he’s showing obvious signs of a vision disorder, but because they have seen the results of what training the eyes to work with the brain-to-hand motion can do for a child.\n\nOn a national level, over the last several years, there has been more attention given to the benefits of vision therapy for athletes. There was an article in the Washington Times on June 13th titled “Eyes Have It With Help of Special Spectacles,” in which several players on the Washington National’s team are using the Nike Strobe glasses, another method of vision therapy. (We actually will be providing these through the office for those that are interested.) This has been the norm with most sports teams, where a few select players on a team receive vision therapy.\n\nThis particular article titled “High Performance Vision Training Improves Batting Statistics for University of Cincinnati Baseball Players” that I am responding to, however, is unusual in that the whole-team participated. The team’s batting average – the team, not a single player – “increased from 0.251 in 2010 to 0.285 in 2011 and the slugging percentage increased by 0.033. The rest of the Big East’s slugging percentage fell over that same time frame 0.082.” For those not familiar with baseball, this is huge, especially for an entire team’s batting average.\n\nI suspect that vision therapy – eye vision training – is going to become more integrated into sports and sports training for both children, as well as adults in the upcoming years, and I think this article speaks towards that.\n\n“<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029109 " target="_blank">High-Performance Vision Training Improves Batting Statistics for University of Cincinnati Baseball Players</a>” by Joseph F.

Then the dreaded “cost” issue comes up.\n\nThe first question that probably comes to your mind is, “Does my health insurance cover this?” Unfortunately, many health insurance companies refuse to cover vision therapy, especially if the therapy appears to be “non-medical” in what it’s addressing. This can be especially frustrating if your health insurance covers other kinds of therapy.\n\nOn top of this, truly effective vision therapy requires a one-on-one therapist with at-home exercises, which can increase the cost versus a computerized vision therapy regimen or completely at-home exercises, which research has shown to be no more effective than a placebo.\n\nSo what are you to do? Your child obviously shows signs of vision disorders, and more than likely your son or daughter’s enjoyment of life, school, learning, and even sports has been negatively affected by their struggles with their vision. Yet the sheer cost of vision therapy is enough to make people balk.\n\nOftentimes, we like to point out to those that are this stage, that vision therapy can be related to braces. Health insurance doesn’t cover all of the cost of braces for most people. And yet people simply put priority on getting their child braces and make it happen financially. Although for some people braces are to address a painful or upcoming issue, many people get braces for purely cosmetic reasons.\n\nKeeping in mind that vision therapy affects multiple facets of your ability to read, retain, and process information, and even in day-to-day life in areas of balance and the ability to measure depth and distance in our three-dimensional world, how much more important is vision therapy compared to a cosmetic reason? We’re not here to say you should pick vision therapy over braces – please, by no means think that – but sometimes we find that people’s priorities for their child’s or even their own are skewed to think that vision therapy is not that important.\n\nWe not just trying to sell you on this, either; we perform our jobs eagerly to see our patients’ eyes light up as they realize they no longer see everything doubled up, or words stop blurring, or they can pitch, catch, and bat a baseball, or they stop bumping into corners, or they’re able to sit down and learn when before it was too tiring and caused a headache. The increased confidence, the relief as their struggle to learn is removed, and the smiles are why we do what we do.\n\nNow, this doesn’t remove the obstacle of cost, especially if your health insurance won’t help.

Some even going so far as to dismiss the efficacy of vision therapy. The Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (or CITT) conclusively demonstrates that convergence insufficiency is best treated by a combination of in-office vision therapy exercises and at-home reinforcement exercises.\n\nAs a result of eye doctors throughout the country failing to support what the current science suggests, convergence insufficiency remains a relatively unknown disorder. However, just because it’s unknown doesn’t mean it’s uncommon. 1 in 12 people suffer from this disorder, and all of the symptoms associated with it:\n\n    Headaches with reading or during close work\n    Loss of attention and concentration for reading or during close work\n    Words moving or doubling when reading or during close work\n    Eye fatigue and/or discomfort with reading or during close work\n    Homework battles: 20 minutes of homework takes hours\n\nIt’s unfortunate that these individuals are far more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD or ADD rather than convergence insufficiency.

Some are born with the condition. Others acquire it through diseases like MS, brain tumors, diabetes, or head injuries. Others may experience the condition as a side effect from prescription medicine. Some experience nystagmus caused by nicotine, bright light flashes, hyperventilation, or deep vibration.\n\nThere are two types of nystagmus. Optokinetic nystagmus is caused within the eye, whereas vestibular nystagmus stems from the inner ear. Inner ear problems may cause jerk nystagmus, where the eyes move slowly in one direction, then jerk back across the visual field, which can cause vertigo as well as nausea. The condition improves with age, but worsens as one tires.\n\nThere is one other cause for nystagmus, however: inebriation. If an individual is drunk, their eyes will dance if they attempt to fix their gaze to the extreme left or right. This was discovered by a vision therapist, and the discovery has led to the development of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, frequently used in field sobriety tests by police officers today.\n\nThere are surgical procedures that seem to help with hereditary nystagmus. Additional treatments include botox, although with temporary results, and biofeedback therapy. Corrective lenses can improve vision for those with nystagmus.\n\nSurgery, drugs, and even acupuncture have been shown to be effective treatments for nystagmus, in addition to recent pharmaceutical discoveries that help smooth the eye movements.

One and one-half percent of the babies born each year come into the world with both anisometropia and amblyopia. The more severe the difference in vision between the eyes, the more likely it is that amblyopia, if not already present, will surface.\n\nSome anisometropics are nearsighted in one eye and farsighted in the other, creating an entirely different set of challenges, but in most cases both eyes are either far or nearsighted, with the vision in one eye being quite good, and the other being quite poor. Depth perception, hand-eye coordination, and other vision problems can result from this inequality of vision.\n\nWith such a large refractive error, it is likely that vision will be impacted by accommodation, the process by which the brain receives visual communication from the stronger eye while ignoring the blurry images from the weaker eye. The longer the process continues, the weaker the eye with poor vision gets, until, in some cases, there is complete vision loss in that eye.\n\nTreatment is usually centered on corrective lenses. The earlier the condition is diagnosed and treated, the easier it is to correct.

Seeing things up close requires something called accommodation. The amount of change that occurs in the lens of an eye, as it moves from relaxed to what is termed fully accommodated, is called the amplitude of accommodation. Contraction of the ciliary muscle causes the lens to move away from the sclera, becoming rounder and changing the diopter power of the eye. The measurement of accommodation in each eye is taken separately.\n\nFor adults, the measurement at which things in the near visual field can be seen clearly is about 20 inches. For a child, that field is reduced to just 2-3 inches. For a young adult the field is about at 4-6 inches, and for an 80-year-old? 60 inches. The greatest change in accommodation amplitude seems to occur between the third and fifth decade of life.\n\nAs we age, our lenses lose elasticity, and thus, we are unable to focus on near field objects as clearly as we when we were young. Tasks such as threading a needle or reading label ingredients on personal care products or food cartons become next to impossible without magnifying glasses.\n\nTo test for near field accommodation, schedule an appointment with Dr. Tod Davis Developmental Optometry & Vision Therapy Services.

Two vision disorders which affect visual tracking, an important skill in many sports, are amblyopia and strabismus.\n\nStrabismus occurs when the two eyes do not physically fixate on the same point, resulting in one eye appearing to be “turned” out, in, up or down. The two disorders can occur simultaneously, with strabismus being the cause of amblyopia (known as strabismic amblyopia). However, the presence of strabismus does not imply the presence of amblyopia, and vice versa. Sometimes, even if a child suffers from strabismus, it may be that the eye turn is so small that it is not noticeable by a visual examination.\n\nWhile strabismus describes a physical “eye turn,” amblyopia describes the condition where the brain suppresses or ignores information coming from one eye, resulting in uneven visual acuity and, in extreme cases, blindness in one eye. Either disorder can negatively impact stereoscopy, or the ability to see in three dimensions. Without stereoscopy, depth perception and hand-eye coordination suffer in a sports setting.\n\nIssues in visual acuity are often the first vision problems to be noticed by parents, as “20/20” acuity screenings are often part of a sport physical and are occasionally required by the school for all students. However, when there still seems to be a visual problem in the child, even after testing yields a “20/20” result or the proper lenses are prescribed, a vision disorder should be your next suspect. A vision disorder, left untreated, can affect a student’s academics as well as their sports performance. If you believe you or your child may have a vision disorder, help is available. Don’t wait.

With Ritalin and Adderall shortages occurring more and more frequently, you would think that this issue would be gaining more attention, if for no other reason than as a possible underlying cause of the spike in ADHD and ADD diagnoses. No such luck.\n\nIn a study done by Dr. Davis B. Granet with 266 patients with CI (convergence insufficiency), there is “an apparent three-fold greater incidence of ADHD among patients with CI when compared with the incidence of ADHD in the general US population (1.8-3.3%) (Leslie et al., 2004).

Health insurance doesn’t cover all of the cost of braces for most people.  And yet people simply put priority on getting their child braces and make it happen financially.  Although for some people braces are to address a painful or upcoming issue, many people get braces for purely cosmetic reasons.\n\nKeeping in mind that vision therapy affects multiple facets of your ability to read, retain, and process information, and even in day-to-day life in areas of balance and the ability to measure depth and distance in our three-dimensional world, how much more important is vision therapy compared to a cosmetic reason?  We’re not here to say you should pick vision therapy over braces – please, by no means think that – but sometimes we find that people’s priorities for their child’s or even their own are skewed to think that vision therapy is not that important.\n\nWe not just trying to sell you on this, either; we perform our jobs eagerly to see our patients’ eyes light up as they realize they no longer see everything doubled up, or words stop blurring, or they can pitch, catch, and bat a baseball, or they stop bumping into corners, or they’re able to sit down and learn when before it was too tiring and caused a headache.

Here are some of those questions:\n<!--more-->\n<strong>Does Hair Obstruct Vision Totally?</strong>\n\nFor the claim that hair in your eyes causes vision problems to hold much water, it would have to be demonstrable that the presence of hair over one’s eye obscures vision from that eye just as much as would wearing an eye patch. We suppose that this is theoretically possible, but would require a particularly thick volume of hair over that eye. Such a thick lock would probably not be kept over the eye, however, as it would rob the person of their ability to see depth effectively. If the wearer of such a hairstyle were involved in any sports, they would quickly see the need for keeping this amount of hair out of their eyes. This leads directly into our next question:\n\n<strong>What is the Minimum Duration of Obstruction before Losing Vision?</strong>\n\nSince we can surmise that an athlete would always keep their theoretically single-eye-blinding hair out of their eyes during a sporting event, we’ll pretend this is a non-athlete. We know that patching is used as part of lazy eye treatments, and is particularly effective against refractive amblyopia. However, even the best-case treatment requires patching for at least 2 – 8 hours per day for 3 months or longer, and this period of patching should be consecutive for best results. \n\nWe also know that the vision in the non-lazy eye tends to recover quickly after patching. Thus, for hair obstruction of vision to work the <em>other</em> way and cause vision <em>loss</em> would require more consecutive obstruction for a longer period of time. Let’s pretend that this would happen at 10 hours per day over the course of one year. Now we have to ask just one more question.\n\n<strong>What is the Likelihood of a “Hair Flip” Occurring During those 10 Hours?\n</strong>\nThink about it. Better yet, look at the picture on the link above. Justin Bieber’s hair is out of his eyes for that picture. How frequently does one specifically move their hair out of their eyes, either for pictures or because their hair is annoying them in its present position? It is highly unlikely that someone would willingly leave their hair in their eyes for 10 hours at one time. In fact, it would take a rather conscious effort by them to not move their hair (or do any activity which might move their hair) for their hair to, in fact, stay put for 10 hours on end.\n\nRemember, this is assuming that the hair caused a perfect obstruction akin to an eye patch. Anything which did not cause this obstruction would most certainly not cause the vision of an eye to become blurry (though it certainly might obstruct vision).

Kelsey Conway came to Dr. Davis when she was 16 years old with “major eye problems” and the help she received from vision therapy has allowed her to become successful in life.  According to Cindy Conway, Kelsey’s mother, five years after vision therapy she has recently graduated from Mary Washington with a B. A. in Historic Preservation and a minor in Museum Studies.  Not only did Kelsey graduate in four years, but she achieved Summa Cum Laude!  She was able to achieve this goal with no special help or accommodations.  She hopes to pursue a master’s degree, but is currently looking for a job in her field.  Kelsey’s inspiring testimony below was written after she had received a year’s worth of vision therapy at age 17:\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>I don’t think that I will ever forget when Dr. Davis looked at me and stated frankly, “You have major eye problems.”  I cried right then and there.  It was an answer, yes, to a question that had been hanging over me since second grade.  Unfortunately, it was in no way, shape, or form the answer I had wanted.  It didn’t matter that over half the population of the United States have these problems.  What is half a country at a time when one feels entirely alone?  I was scared, furious, and truly devastated.\n\nFrom the time I was small, I had odd little quirks.  When I wasn’t knocking into things or falling down for no apparent reason, (I did this so often my parents nicknamed me Lump Head and gave me a theme song), I was making silly errors in school, which resembled Dyslexia.  My most serious defect was in spelling.  Even after years of rules and phonics, I would spell the same word three different ways in one paper.  Reading was second in line on my list of grievances.  I read slowly, stumbling often and misreading entire sentences.  Math, though least defined, was just as exasperating.  The number of errors my work contained was just as embarrassing as it was frustrating.  Because these difficulties persisted, when I was 16 years old my parents called in the help of a tutor.  The tutor realized that I did not need her expertise, so I was sent to Fredericksburg Learning Center for testing.  These tests revealed that I did not have Dyslexia, but that the answer to my problems lay in an area of vision we had never heard of before, Developmental Optometry.  It was then that Dr. Davis diagnosed me with Binocular Fusion Disorder, using these three terrible words, “major eye problems.”\n\nBinocular Fusion Disorder can be described as visual overload.  My eyes do not work together to send my brain correct, easily processed information.  This causes my brain to simply shut off certain functions of my eyes.  Periphery is one thing my brain annihilated, giving me tunnel vision.  It also represses whichever of my eyes is acting up, and generally wreaks havoc on my ability to connect the sensory dots.  I do not know if my brain does this out of desperation or revenge, but I am now working to train my eyes to get along and have my brain stay out of their business.  Weekly therapy sessions with Dr. and Mrs. Davis and the support from my wonderful family, have helped me through this whole mess.\n\nI had a lot of issues getting over the initial shock and denial, which accompanied my diagnosis. Then came a blatant loathe and resistance to the many therapy exercises including ‘Stick Near Far’, ‘The Star Chart’, and ‘The Duck and Pigeon’.  Dr. and Mrs. Davis gave me these exercises and many other nifty contraptions, instructing me to flail about until I felt completely and utterly ridiculous, all to retrain my misbehaving eyes.  One thing I continue to hold in contempt is my prism glasses.  I am supposed to wear them for all close-up work because my eyes, even today, get fatigued and I end up two inches from the paper.  Even so, eye therapy has helped more than I expected.  The initial “And how on earth is this going to help?” has passed, and things are going much smoother.\n\nThough my math still contains many careless mistakes (I am beginning to suspect I am just a poor mathematician and it has nothing to do with my eyes), my spelling has begun to improve.  Reading is easier, and I am proud to announce that I have shed the nickname Lump Head!  It has taken over a year, and I am not completely finished ridding my eyes of their nasty little habits.  At times I wonder if I will ever be able to spell ‘another’ without adding an uninvited ‘u’, or if I will ever be able to read like Speedy Gonzales, but I know I will never let this be an excuse to give up.  Perhaps I may encounter obstacles between myself and my dreams, but “major eye problems” are no longer among them.</blockquote>', 'College and Beyond: A Success Story from Kelsey Conway', 'Kelsey’s story has a single message of hope, which can serve as great comfort for all parents who have children that suffer from eye problems.

However, with symptoms that often are similar to each other, vision disorders in children may sometimes be misdiagnosed as ADHD.\n<!--more-->\nConvergence insufficiency is a common visual disorder which affects the coordination of the eyes. An estimated 1 in 20 children suffer from convergence insufficiency. But, what is convergence insufficiency? First, let me explain the concept of convergence: When reading, writing, drawing, or doing other work that requires up-close attention, a person’s eyes must turn in, or converge, in order for the image of the work to be clear. \n\nConvergence happens smoothly and subconsciously in those without convergence insufficiency. However, those who suffer from the disorder have difficulty turning their eyes inward. As a result, conscious effort must be made to focus on close objects, which is very tiring. \n\nHave you ever crossed your eyes? Imagine feeling like you had to do that in order to read, and imagine being expected to maintain that focus for minutes or even hours at a time. This is how reading feels to those with convergence insufficiency. It’s no wonder they have difficulty focusing on their work! \n\nThis extra exertion, naturally, causes a number of uncomfortable symptoms, such as eyestrain, headaches and blurred vision. Children with convergence insufficiency may experience difficulty concentrating, read slowly, read the same line repeatedly, have trouble remembering what they read, or frequently lose their place. This may result in inattentiveness at school and while completing homework, or a general avoidance of such close work.\n\nHere’s the problem: To a parent, or even a medical practitioner, all of these symptoms suggest ADHD. Those with convergence insufficiency may even have 20/20 vision, further complicating diagnoses. In a 2000 study, it was demonstrated that children diagnosed with ADHD are three times more likely to have convergence insufficiency than children who have not been so diagnosed. Clearly, there is reason to believe that some of those children would not need ADHD medications if their struggle with convergence insufficiency was to be fully addressed and treated. \n\nThis is why we recommend the following: If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, or is exhibiting some of the signs of convergence insufficiency or ADHD, a thorough developmental vision exam by a developmental optometrist should be your first step in treating the disorder. It’s a decision that could save your child the stigma of being diagnosed with ADHD, and save you money on medications.', 'How Convergence Insufficiency Can Sometimes Act Like ADHD', 'If your child has trouble focusing on reading, writing, or a homework assignment for more than 15 minutes at a time, you have probably been told that his or her symptoms suggest Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as the underlying cause.

A child may not necessarily be exhibiting signs of a learning issue (such as fussing over homework or showing a slower progression among their classmates) in order for a vision disorder to be present. Even children who are otherwise gifted learners can still suffer from vision disorders. Therefore, convergence insufficiency, amblyopia, and other disorders of vision are not and should not be attributed only to “slow learners” or “reluctant readers.”\n<!--more-->\nDifficulty learning is usually the sign of a vision problem that most parents pay attention to. Because of this, it is often the case that an intelligent child is not brought in for diagnosis until their academic performance suffers. At this point, the parents are often confused by the child’s struggles in certain areas. The parents may even mistake the reduced performance, such as on a written test, as a sign of laziness in the child. These children are often performing adequately enough to not qualify for additional in-school help, which can reinforce this assumption.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the gifted child may otherwise be extremely verbal, and do perfectly on verbal tests. In fact, he or she may be able to answer questions on a written test correctly when asked them verbally. When there is a disparity such as this, seeking a thorough vision screening should be a parent’s immediate reaction. A functional vision test goes far beyond the “20/20” eye chart examination with which we are all so familiar. This vision assessment tests the full range visual health factors, including eye tracking, eye teaming and convergence. By testing all aspects of vision, this screening uncovers vision disorders such as convergence insufficiency, amblyopia, eye-teaming issues and computer vision syndrome.\n\nWhen such disorders come to light, the good news is that they are often treatable without surgery or glasses. Vision therapy, a series of exercises meant to re-train the eyes to function according to their intended function, corrects a wide variety of vision disorders. The result is that the child is better able to see and interpret written materials, allowing their natural giftedness to shine through all the more.', 'Gifted Children and Vision Disorders', 'It might come as a surprise, but there are gifted children that have vision disorders.

Davis</em>\n\nRecently, the new 3D technology has been receiving a significant amount of attention, especially with the option of 3D at the theaters, a new Nintendo 3DS, classroom use of 3D technology, and even 3D home televisions. The American Optometric Association, with the explosion of 3D technology, has issued a public health warning article titled “3D in the Classroom: See Well, Learn Well.” The purpose of the article is to educate the public about people who are uncomfortable with watching 3D, as there have been an increasing number of these reports.\n\nWhat does it mean to be uncomfortable with viewing 3D on a screen? In most cases, this is a strong sign of a binocular vision disorder, such as convergence insufficiency. <!--more-->Convergence insufficiency is when the eyes have issues working together at close range, also known as an eye teaming problem, where the eyes drift out despite trying to do near work. In an effort to keep the eyes working, the individual has to: make an extra effort to bring the eyes together (which causes fatigue, headache, etc.); cover one eye; or, the brain will actually suppress the vision in one eye, all to avoid swimming letters and double vision.\n\nSome people have said that if watching 3D movies bothers an individual, than that individual should simply not look at 3D screens. However, the reality is that an issue with viewing 3D properly is strong evidence that there’s a problem with the viewer’s binocular vision.\n\nThere has always been 3D for people: The real world and binocular vision work together to create the same effect. In fact, 3D viewing technologies enable us to screen for vision disorders in a new and very efficient way: When someone with a vision disorder watches a program or movie, or plays a game which utilizes this technology, they suffer from the “3D’s of Viewing 3D: dizziness, discomfort and lack of depth.” This is also known as 3D Vision Syndrome, and it reveals vision disorders such as convergence insufficiency.\n\nHere is the good news: binocular conditions such as convergence insufficiency are treatable. This is where vision therapy comes in. Vision therapy can help a child (or an adult, even) with eye teaming issues. People that struggle to do work at close range – or that struggle to watch 3D screens – don’t have to continue to struggle, and through the work of vision therapy they can retrain the eyes to work together properly, giving them both excellent binocular vision in real life, and the ability to watch 3D screens.\n\nIn addition, viewing anything in 3D, be it a video game, movie, or television program, has no worse impact on the viewer than the 2D equivalent. Certainly, you should limit the viewing of television, especially for children; yet, this is true whether the television is in 2D or 3D. This makes 3D technology a boon to schools, homes, and theaters as more and more people are “tested” for vision disorders (such as convergence insufficiency) in the name of education and fun!\n\nI maintain that for these reasons, the increase in 3D technology is a good thing. The use of the 3D technology has been, and will continue to be, extremely helpful in the diagnosis of vision disorders such as convergence insufficiency.\n\n<strong>Sources &amp; Resources:</strong>\n“3D in the Classroom: See Well, Learn Well” editorial by Dominick M.

Aug. 16, 2011</strong> - This August, as children head back to schools which have reduced budgets, National Children’s Vision & Learning Month takes on new meaning.  Teachers and administrators now need to be more creative in order to help their students succeed.  This may include challenging previous concepts regarding vision and learning.<!--more-->\n<br/>Two educators from New Jersey have shed some light on why teachers and administrators across the US are rethinking their model of vision and how it relates to learning.  Many students with attention problems, learning disabilities, and gifted students that don’t achieve to their potential have one thing in common, vision disorders that have contributed to their learning difficulties.\n<br/>Nicole Moore, Principal of Indian Mills Elementary School, shares, <em>“As a principal who sits on the intervention services committee, we try to do whatever is possible to stop children from needing to be classified for special education services.  One of the interventions that parents have told me makes a big difference in their children’s ability to read and learn is optometric vision therapy.”</em>\n<br/><em>“Our district has one of the lowest rates of student classification for special education in the county,”</em> Moore continues, <em>“I believe screening and remediation of learning-related vision problems have been a significant factor in reducing the number of children referred for special education services.”</em>\n<br/>Moore credits Barbara Scola, the Director of Pupil Services, for bringing optometric vision therapy to her school as one of the many interventions necessary to help their students.\n<br/>When asked what prompted Scola to consider that vision might be one of the missing links to helping students learn, she recalled, <em>“I was working on my master’s thesis on reading interventions and had the opportunity to work with a student who had excellent comprehension when the material was read to him, but struggled when he tried to read on his own.” </em> \n<br/>As she worked with him she found that he knew his words in isolation, yet when he saw the same words at the beginning of a line in a paragraph he didn’t recognize them because he cut off the first two letters.  For example, <em>“Treat yourself to some ice cream”</em> he would read as <em>“Eat yourself to some ice cream.”</em>  Scola tried teaching him context clues to help it make sense, to force him to go back and look at the beginnings of the words, but it was laborious.\n<br/><em>“This was quite a mystery, so I started researching to see what it could be.  I suspected that his vision might be playing a role, so I started searching for information on learning disabilities and vision.  And that’s what lead me to optometric vision therapy,”</em> Scola continued.   \n<br/>Following Scola’s recommendation, the mother took her child to an optometrist who had an in-office vision therapy program.  After completing optometric vision therapy, he did very well in school.\n<br/>Once Scola received her Master’s Degree in Education Administration, she joined Moore in the Shamong School District as the Director of Pupil Services and began implementing her new strategies. The mother of one of the first children who went through optometric vision therapy was working on her Ph.D. in Reading. Scola had encouraged her to give vision therapy a try, <em>“she did not believe us at all, she thought it was bunk. Even with all of her education she had never heard of it. But her daughter couldn''t read, so we said it can''t hurt, just try it.”</em> And now her daughter is an avid reader and an excellent student thanks to optometric vision therapy.  \n<br/><strong>Some of the most common signs that a pupil may have a learning related vision disorder are:</strong>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Homework battles even though the child is bright and may do well in school (because their eyes are tired at the end of the day from straining to focus),</li>\n	<li>Tilts head or lays head on the desk during reading</li>\n	<li>Short attention span when reading</li>\n	<li>Poor reading comprehension</li>\n	<li>Skips lines, rereads lines.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>Moore encourages other principals and administrators to "<em>think outside the box when it comes to learning or reading issues; I had never heard of optometric vision therapy before.  Now we know what to look for in children with possible vision disorders and with vision therapy we have seen significant changes in these children’s’ ability and enjoyment of reading."</em>\n<br/>Moore and Scola (now the Director of Special Services at Winslow Schools) were delighted to learn that the American Optometric Association responded to President Obama''s call to ensure that no child is left behind in the classroom due to an undetected or untreated eye or vision disorder, by holding a School Readiness Summit in Washington, DC.  The summit''s interdisciplinary workgroup - comprising nearly 50 leaders in their respective fields - documented and recognized the established link between healthy vision and classroom learning.\n<br/>As a result of this Summit, the American Federation of Teachers issued the following statement: <em>“Even the most gifted students will struggle academically if they have trouble seeing the blackboard or focusing on a book. A tremendous amount of learning happens visually, so proper vision care is crucial to helping students reach their full potential.”</em>\n<br/>Scola explains to parents, <em>“It doesn’t matter if your child is gifted or not, if vision isn’t working right, your eyes don’t send the right signals to your brain.  It’s like having a real high speed computer, but if the keyboard isn''t working, you get the wrong information, if any.”  </em>\n<br/>Dr. Tod R. Davis, a developmental optometrist who has an office in Fredericksburg, VA, and who diagnoses and treats vision problems that interfere with academic success says, <em>“I have seen a lot of children from  all over the Prince William County area who struggled with reading before the underlying vision problem was found and treated.  I hope that educators in our area are inspired by what Ms. Scola and Ms. Moore have done in their schools.”</em>\n<br/>Dr. Bradley Habermehl, President of the College of Optometrists in Vision Development (COVD) concurs, <em>“We are delighted to see educators, such as Ms. Moore and Ms. Scola, embracing optometric vision therapy.  We receive large numbers of thank you letters from parents who were at their wits end, thanking vision therapy for changing the lives of their children.”</em>\n<br/>Please join COVD in this year’s campaign for National Children’s Vision & Learning Month and visit us at www.COVD.org where you can learn about how vision disorders can cause even the brightest children to struggle with learning.\n<br/>\n<strong>About Developmental Optometry & Vision Therapy Services</strong>\nDevelopmental Optometry & Vision Therapy Services, operated under Dr. Tod Davis, is a talented and compassionate staff that specializes in developmental vision care and vision therapy.

Some people suffer from double vision consistently in their lives; this condition is referred to as diplopia. Diplopia can cause headaches and other common ailments, and it takes the help of a studied Optometrist to treat the condition of double vision. Dr. Tod Davis is one such specialist, and is the main developmental optometrist at Dr. Tod Davis Developmental Optometry and Vision Therapy Services. He believes that with some hard work, both children and adults can see tremendous results and a major life change. With offices in Gainesville, Fairfax, Fredericksburg, and Winchester, they strive to provide the best vision therapy treatments in the area. Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle have more than 30 years of experience helping both children and adults to turn vision disorders into functional vision through therapy, and they would love to meet you and help you achieve a major life change.\n\n<strong>How Does Double Vision Occur?</strong>\n\nDouble vision can come into play in two different ways. Strabismus is the failure of both eyes to fuse images into one three dimensional picture to display for the mind. If one is plagued with strabismus, their eyes do not point at one object at the same time, causing double vision and the inability for the brain to digest one single picture. The second way that one can acquire the condition of double vision is if they have a refractive error that has not been corrected. When there is a refractive error in one’s vision, they view of an object is split into two images due to error in the optical system; this can be caused by astigmatism, keratoconus and cataracts.\n\n<strong>What Trials Does Double Vision Cause?</strong>\n\nIn the case of double vision, the brain will block out one image that the mind is seeing in order to process the visual information that it receives. If this visual suppression occurs for a long period of time, especially in children, the visual system can become permanently impaired. When one eye becomes consistently suppressed it can become lazy, a common condition that is medically referred to as amblyopia. It can be difficult to treat the side effects of Strabismus as they are a physiological result of the brain working to correct the ailment.\n\n<strong>How Can Double Vision Be Treated?</strong>\n\nBefore attempting to treat double vision, one must visit an Optometrist in order to find which condition is causing the vision to duplicate. If one suffers from Strabismus they may have to undergo surgical straightening of the eye, practice eye exercises or go through a combination of both treatments. Eye therapy or exercises are practiced with the goal of straightening the strabismic eye without surgery and in turn repair the visual pathway that is not properly connecting to the brain. If double vision is related to astigmatism a patient will be prescribed corrective lenses to alleviate their duplicate vision. If cataracts are present in the optical system then a patient will possibly be referred to cataract surgery in order to repair the issue.\n\nWhichever cause or treatment is necessary to repair double vision, the guidance of an experienced Optometrist is necessary. Regular visits to an optometrist from the age of six months are ideal for attaining optimal eye health. If a patient has been visiting an eye doctor for regular checkups, then it is less likely that they will have to take part in surgery to correct their double vision problems.', 'How to Identify and Correct Double Vision', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'how-to-identify-and-correct-double-vision', '', '', '2013-10-06 08:06:11', '2013-10-06 08:06:11', '', 0, 'http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/?p=654', 0, 'post', '', 0),

This can lead to serious vision loss if not detected and treated early. The optic nerve is the nerve that takes all of the information the eye sees and transmits that information to the brain. The elevated pressure is due to either an increase in the production, or a decrease in the drainage of fluid normally produced inside your eye. Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in United States.\n\nUnfortunately, glaucoma has almost no visual symptoms until it is very far advanced and vision is almost gone. Scheduling an eye exam with our office is the only way to determine if you have glaucoma.\n\nThe exact cause and mechanism of glaucoma is not yet known. For some reason, there is an overproduction of fluid and/or a decrease in fluid being drained from the eye. This results in fluid building up within your eye and increasing pressure on the optic nerve. This pressure can easily damage the nerve fibers and blood vessels in the optic nerve. An injury, infection or tumor in or around the eye can also cause the pressure to rise. These situations are referred to as secondary glaucoma because their cause is a result of something else.\n\nIf diagnosed at an early stage, eye drops and laser treatment can control glaucoma and little or no further vision loss should occur.\n\nIf you think you might be at risk for glaucoma or experiencing symptoms of it, there is help. Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle of Dr. Tod Davis Developmental Optometry and Vision Therapy Services have more than 30 years of expertise helping people with deteriorated or low vision.

Optimal binocularity, when both eyes are aimed singly at given point of distance, results in the merging (fusion) of both images into one three dimensional picture.\n\n<strong>What Factors Inhibit Binocularity?</strong>\n\nInadequate vision development during childhood is a hefty factor in the lack of binocularity or eye teaming. Sometimes trauma including tumors, disease or injury can affect one’s binocularity and lead to poor fusion.\n\n<strong>How Will Weak Binocularity Affect Vision?</strong>\n\nWherethere is a lack of eye muscle control, a person tends to compensate in ways that overtire or stress the visual system excessively. The extra exertion of the eye muscle tends to be the cause of headaches in those who suffer with problems in eye teaming.In severe cases the two pictures provided by each eye cannot be fused and double vision will occur. The brain sometimes attempts to alleviate these stressors by “ignoring” one of the images provided by the eyes, which is called suppression. In children it is possible that the child could develop visual impairment called amblyopia (lazy eye) where an eye is suppressed for too long by the brain becomes extremely weak.\n\n<strong>How Are Binocular Problems Diagnosed?</strong>\n\nThere are many symptoms that imply an adult could be suffering from poor binocularity:\n<ul>\n	<li>Double vision</li>\n	<li>Headaches</li>\n	<li>Eye and body fatigue</li>\n	<li>Irritability</li>\n	<li>Dizziness</li>\n	<li>Difficulty reading or concentrating</li>\n</ul>\nIf a child is suffering from poor binocularity the following signs and symptoms may be present:\n<ul>\n	<li>Covering one eye</li>\n	<li>Head Tilting</li>\n	<li>Skipping lines or losing their place while reading</li>\n	<li>Poor sports performance</li>\n	<li>Avoiding tasks that require close work</li>\n	<li>Tiring easily</li>\n</ul>\nMany common signs and symptoms of poor binocularity can be attributed to other issues, medical or otherwise. Many adults and children have undiagnosed vision problems like convergence insufficiency or amblyopia because their symptoms are misread, misunderstood or misdiagnosed. Simply put, people in general are not informed about vision related problems. This is why it is beneficial to schedule an appointment with Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle Developmental Optometry and Vision Therapy Services, beginning at the age of six months. With regular check-ups our experienced Developmental Optometrist and professional staff are able to diagnose vision problems and treat them successfully. The only way to detect developmental vision problems is with a Developmental Optometrist, most eye exams only detect problems with visual acuity (20/20 vision).\n\n<strong>How Is Poor Binocularity And Other Vision Problems Treated?</strong>\n\nThis condition cannot be solved simply by utilizing prescription glasses or contact lens. Inadequate binocularity is generally treated with vision therapy along with specialized glasses. Vision therapy is a sequence of activities individually prescribed and monitored by a Developmental Optometrist and administered by a Vision Therapist to develop efficient visual skills and processing.

Many parents deal with children who struggle with learning and behavior problems like Autism and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Many of those parents are confronted with the decision to give their child prescription medications like Ritalin, Adderall, Strattera and Wellbutrin, to name only a few. Each of these drugs has been prescribed to millions of children in the United States in the past two decades. Since 2007, 2.7 million youth ages 4-17 have been prescribed drugs for ADHD, according to the Center for Disease Control.\n\nThe wide ranges of unintended effects of the drugs are only beginning to be understood. Many of the symptoms of ADHD can be attributed to other diagnosis, such as vision related problems like convergence insufficiency, which can be treated successfully without drugs through Vision Therapy.

In these cases it is possible to suffer from dry eye, also medically referred to as keratoconjunctivitis (KCS), xerophthalmia or dry eye syndrome (DES). This ailment is most commonly found in humans but is also present in some animals. The tears that are produced by the eye are necessary to have clear vision and maintain overall eye health, a lack of tear production can harm your vision.\n\n<strong>What can cause dry eye syndrome or keratoconjunctivitis?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hormonal changes</li>\n<li>Normal aging process</li>\n<li>Environmental irritants</li>\n<li>Problems with normal blinking</li>\n<li>Medications (antihistamines, oral contraceptives and antidepressants)</li>\n<li>UV exposure</li>\n<li>Arthritis</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>How will dry eye harm my eye health?</strong>\n\nDry eye syndrome is most harmful to the ocular system if left untreated. If suffering from excessive dry eye you may experience tissue damage and possible scarring to your corneal tissues which can impair vision. If you wear contact lenses to help your vision, dry eye can cause irritation and raise the risk of eye infection. In order to fully subdue dry eye syndrome you must work closely with an Optometrist and follow their instructions carefully. It is important to let Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle know immediately if treatment or prescriptions for your dry eye syndrome are not working adequately.\n\n<strong>Will there be symptoms related to dry eye syndrome?</strong>\n\nThere can be multiple signs that you are suffering from dry eye. You may experience excessive tearing in a physiological response to dryness. Other symptoms include gritty, stinging, scratchy and uncomfortable eyes, fluctuating vision, and/or a burning feeling or the feeling of a foreign object in the eye.\n\nIn order to properly diagnose DES, you must get an examination with an optometrist who can assess your medical history and current physical state in order to determine what may be causing your symptoms. Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle can help and may need to do further dry eye testing including combining special dyes and a microscope to evaluate tear distribution and tear quantity in your body.\n\n<strong>Can dry eye be cured?</strong>\n\nThe first step to curing dry eye syndrome is to make an appointment at one of our 4 convenient office locations so that we can do further testing and assess the exact cause of your DES. Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle Developmental Optometry and Vision Therapy Services is one of the best optometry offices in Virginia for accurately diagnosing the cause of eye ailments and vision problems, including dry eye.\n\nDry eye is generally chronic and incurable, but can be remedied for a short time utilizing artificial tears which will also reduce the risk of harming the eyes. If the DES is an extreme case there are gels and ointments that can be used before bed. It is also possible that adding fish and flax seed oil to your diet will help your body to naturally solve the problem of dry eye.\n\nIt is important to always consult with an optometrist , like Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle, before attempting any remedy, they will know precisely which drops, gels or ointments will be most appropriate for your specific needs.', 'Dry Eye Syndrome: Causes, Symptoms & Treatment', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'dry-eye-syndrome-causes-symptoms-treatment', '', '', '2013-11-06 05:50:57', '2013-11-06 05:50:57', '', 0, 'http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/?p=679', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Although born with sight and hearing, Helen was rendered blind and deaf by an illness at 19 months of age. Because of her disabilities, Helen did not develop typical language skills and by the age of six only had a rudimentary "home based sign language" of about sixty words. Fortunately Helen''s parents pursued means to help her develop and were eventually introduced to Anne Sullivan who began a process of teaching Helen to communicate. Over time Helen not only learned to communicate but was able to develop an understanding of her environment and thrive in it. So how did Helen Keller have good vision?\n\n<div><a href="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Helen-Keller.jpg"><img src="http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Helen-Keller.jpg" alt="Helen-Keller" title="Helen-Keller" width="241" height="301" class="size-full wp-image-688" style="border:1px solid #cdcdcd;" /></a></div>\n<p style="color:#333; font-weight:bold; margin-top:-5px; font-size:9px;">Helen Keller</p>\n\nVision is more than sight and acuity.  It is the comprehensive ability to organize what is seen so that it can be understood. That understanding is then used to guide and direct one’s actions in an environment to achieve what is needed and/or wanted to survive and thrive.  As Dr. Melvin Kaplin put it in his book Seeing Through New Eyes, "It is not just seeing clearly but obtaining meaning and understanding about what is seen."\nVision is the brain''s ability to unify sensory information derived from our eyes, vestibular system (inner ear system responsible for balance and coordination), and proprioceptive system (sensory information from our skin, muscles and tendons). The sum total of the information creates a perceptual image of our environment that we use to visualize our intended movements and interactions. The visualization of our intended movements, interactions and activities in our environment precedes the action itself, even if we''re not necessarily aware of it. This is what Helen Keller was able to develop over time despite blindness.\n\nUnfortunately not everyone fully develops their visual-perceptual abilities due to array of circumstances like neurological disease and injury, and vision related problems that stem from delayed or interrupted childhood development. The good news is that most of those whose vision did not develop optimally can be helped through developmental optometry and vision therapy. Developmental Optometrist, like Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle, can expertly diagnose and treat vision related problems. Their professional staff and Vision Therapist have been changing lives through vision therapy.\nHelen Keller''s personal struggle and eventual triumph can be analogous to the struggles of anyone who has suffered from vision related problems and has undergone vision therapy. In particularly anyone who’s ability to create a perceptual image of their environment was impaired or never properly developed. Many vision therapy patients work hard and struggle to obtain the gift so many others take for granted the gift of vision.

These small areas of cloudiness or large opaque areas may cause highly noticeable blurring of vision. Cataracts are generally found in people over the age of 60 and are a result aging; however there are some cases of cataracts in younger people and newborns. When a child is born with a cataract it is medically referred to as a congenital cataract. \n\nCloudiness of cataracts is a sign of aging changes in your eyes which can be hereditary, an injury or signs of disease. Excessive exposure to cigarette smoke, ultraviolet radiation or certain medications can raise the factor of risk in developing cataracts. They will usually develop in both eyes at different rates as a sign of advancing age. \n\n<strong>What are the signs of Cataracts?</strong>\n\nBlurred or hazy vision can be a symptom of developing cataracts assuming that it cannot be corrected by a prescription change in one’s glasses. Also, a feeling of having a film over the eyes that cannot be subdued by blinking can be an indicator of cataracts. You may experience an increased sensitivity to glare, especially at night, and a temporary change in near and/or far distance vision. Cataracts can develop with no pain or redness which makes it necessary to be attending a regular Optometry checkup to ensure that you can nip cataract development in the bud. \n\n<strong>How do I treat Cataracts?</strong>\n\nIf you are in the early stages of Cataract development and your vision is only affected minimally, Drs. Tod Davis and Amy can sometimes reassess your glasses prescription in order to sharpen your vision. If the Cataracts begin to get in the way of daily life and glasses do not help, we can refer you to an Ophthalmologist who can further assess if you are in need of surgical removal of your Cataracts.\n\n<strong>What is involved in Cataract surgery?</strong>\n\nThe time it takes to develop Cataracts varies between cases, sometimes they may develop slowly over years and in some cases they form rapidly. Similarly, some cases never develop to the point that they require surgical removal. Surgery is required once glasses can no longer provide vision correction. \n\nIn surgery, your old cloudy lens will be removed and replaced with an intraocular lens implant that will serve as your ‘new lens.’ In some cases of lens replacement, eye sight can provide adequate enough distance vision that glasses are not necessary any longer; however, you will still need reading glasses to assist with near sight. About four weeks after lens implant surgery, we would recommend setting an appointment at one our convenient locations to receive a new prescription lens for your glasses. \n\nThere is a wide spectrum of Cataracts that affect vision; from the very harmful to barely noticeable differences in near or farsightedness. Either way, it is imperative that you visit an eye doctor regularly in order to keep your vision as sharp as possible and maintain a proper assessment of your eye health. \n', 'Cataracts', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'cataracts', '', '', '2013-11-06 06:31:11', '2013-11-06 06:31:11', '', 0, 'http://www.davisvisiontherapy.com/blog/?p=701', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I suddenly started to have severe attacks of vertigo almost daily. Before I knew it, I felt extremely dizzy and off balance <em>every second of every day</em>. My head felt like it was going to explode all the time. After several months I could no longer keep up with high school. I had gone from being an honor roll student to having report cards full of Ds and Fs. No matter how hard I tried, I could no longer track the lines I was reading. If I managed to read something, I could no longer remember it.\n\nDuring my teenage years, my parents took me to many specialists. I went through extensive testing, including MRIs and inner ear testing. I was diagnosed with an inner ear virus and then with migraine associated vertigo. I tried medications and dietary changes. Nothing worked.\n\nIn the meantime, the constant dizziness was taking a toll on the rest of my body. I developed chronic fatigue syndrome at the age of seventeen. When I was eighteen I started having sharp headaches behind my eyes. Treatments for these secondary illnesses did not help either. After several years I lost my confidence in the medical profession, so I gave up.\n\nIt wasn''t a surprise that when my optometrist suggested I try vision therapy, I was incredibly skeptical.

45 degree angle.  When he learned to crawl, he would close his eyes as he neared a wall and would hit his head into it due to his lack of depth perception.  He was also very "clumsy" and would fall off of curbs, couches, chairs, etc..  We never connected this to an eye issue until much later.\n\nAt his Pre-k, his teacher said the kids were copying off the wall and Lucas got up and had to read what it said.  I immediately made him an eye appointment.  When we arrived at my eye doctor, I was shocked to find my son could only see out of one eye.  His right eye was the lazy eye.  They gave him a very strong eye prescription and told me to patch his eye for two hours daily.  He adjusted to the glasses right away and told me he never saw the points in the leaves of a tree and thought all trees had apples.  He absolutely hated the patching and would find ways to hide it or wear it incorrectly.  It was a constant battle and then more battles developed.\n\nHe started kindergarten with two worksheets each night.  It would take close to two hours of prodding and prying to get it done.  He couldn''t use the number chart because it was too confusing and math and reading frustrated him the most.  He is very talented in art, but his ability to sit for long periods of time was not there.  His teacher suggested he had ADHD.  I disagreed.  I teach high school students and have seen their writing.  Lucas was a perfectionist, something else was wrong.\n\nNot only did we struggle with homework, but with how things felt to Lucas.  He hated all his socks and could never get them straight.  I would literally be asking him to get dressed for an hour before school because something didn''t feel right to him.  We would go through several shirts, pants, socks, etc..  He also hated sitting still.  Some people said this was what a boy did, but it became to the point that it was throwing his focus off in school.  I knew something had to be done, but wasn''t sure what.\n\nI looked up some information on the Internet.  I started giving him Omega-3 supplements and thinking that would help him with his concentration.  I also got wind of Vision Therapy and started thinking that this sounded good.  I found a place in Frederick and we took Lucas.  Again, it turned out they just wanted to patch and go no further.  Lucas struggled through 1st grade, but I kept advocating for him and the teacher and I came up with some techniques to get him through most days.  I was called often because his underwear didn''t feel right and any time they did math, he suddenly had the urge to go to the bathroom.  In both kindergarten and first grade Lucas got marks on his report card stating that he could not focus, needed to not talk out, and needed to work on self-control.\n\nWe knew he was smart, but Lucas would say he was stupid.  He also would say he could not stop from doing what he did or that he didn''t see what was happening.  During the summer after 1st grade, I was determined to find a Vision Therapy doctor nearby.  We live in Falling Waters, West Virginia, so when I saw Dr. Davis in Winchester, I made a call.  This call was our family''s God-send.  We were so blessed to find Dr. Davis and it has truly changed Lucas'' world for what we hope he will always have -- confidence.\n\nAs soon as Dr. Davis examined Lucas, he realized the prescription was too strong and that Lucas was not comfortable in his skin.  He did several things that day to illustrate that Lucas'' eyes and brain were not in sync with each other.  He showed me how Lucas held his hands and feet a certain way and how he spun his head around to follow a light.  He suggested my husband and I meet to go over the testing that Lucas got that day.\n\nWhen my husband and I met with Dr. Davis, we went in saying that whatever we could do for Lucas we would do.  Dr. Davis explained what could be done with Vision Therapy and then we were shown the cost.  Our insurance did not cover this and we wondered if we could make it happen.  On the car ride home we decided we would make some sacrifices to make this happen for Lucas and it has truly been worth every penny.  We also made sure Lucas had a 504 in place showing these tests and Dr. Davis'' recommendations for his accommodations.  Dr. Davis and his entire staff were so helpful during this part of the process.\n\nLucas went through therapy for a year and a half.  His 2nd grade teacher saw the biggest leaps since he started the therapy a month before 2nd grade.  He changed so much at home as well.  He could wear any sock, shirt, jean, etc. without it feeling weird.  Homework was done within 15-20 minutes and normally without my help.  His grades improved especially in math and reading.  Lucas started to feel good about himself.  Every morning before school, we would do four activities suggested by his therapist and then he would go off to school.\n\nDuring the summer, we kept up the strategies and also did Dynamic Reader.  He liked the program and progressed well with it.  When Lucas started 3rd grade, I decided to just let him try some things on his own before talking with his teacher.  One day I got a call from his teacher and she said she wanted to know why Lucas had a 504.  I explained his vision and she said, if you didn''t tell me this, I never would have known.  He is a great student.  Lucas just got his report card and received 3 B''s and 7 A''s.  The B''s were two percentage points away from an A.  His teacher believes he can get all A''s and now Lucas is believing it as well.\n\nVision Therapy has saved my son from a life of frustration, acting-out, and struggle.  I cannot thank Dr. Davis and his practice and staff enough.  If you worry about the money, it is worth it.  If you worry about the time, it is worth it.  If you don''t think the results are there yet, be patient and then be amazed at the results.  We are thanking God each day for leading us to Dr. Davis and his office.  Our son''s brain and eyes will now communicate for a lifetime and he will forever be comfortable in his own skin.  Vision therapy was the only way he could ever achieve this and we support this practice for a lifetime.\n\nLisa S.', 'Success Story of “Lisa”', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'success-story-of-lisa', '', '', '2013-11-14 11:01:12', '2013-11-14 11:01:12', '', 0,

This can occur if your cornea has too little curvature or the length of your eyeball is too short, causing nearby objects unable to be brought into a clearly focused sharp image. This condition can be brought on by environmental factors or be a hereditary issue. \n\n<strong>Is Hyperopia a common problem?</strong>\n\nMany people suffer from mild cases of farsightedness without ever knowing it and it is far more common than you may think. Hyperopia only becomes an obvious problem if it has a significant effect on your ability to see things in everyday life, for instance while driving. As you age, it is normal to experience a natural decrease in focusing ability is normal, over half of the people who wear glasses are attempting to assist with their hyperopia or presbyopia (nearsightedness). Hyperopia can be easily overlooked during sight test or auto refraction, making it necessary to visit your optometrist regularly to keep track of your refractive error and find the perfect glasses prescription for your particular gauge of hyperopia. \n\n<strong>What symptoms occur from farsightedness?</strong>\n\nThose who are suffering from Hyperopia will naturally exert extra effort to maintain clear vision of long distance and even more involuntary effort to view objects at a close range.  This extra energy being used to see clearly can cause tension, fatigue, headaches and discomfort. Blurred vision will also occur in the event that the crystalline lens of the eye cannot bring an object into focus. \n\n<strong>Common Symptoms of Hyperopia Include:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Trouble maintaining clear focus on near objects</li>\n<li>Blurred vision</li>\n<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>\n<li>Eye strain</li>\n<li>Fatigue</li>\n<li>Headaches</li>\n<li.Aching or burning eyes</li>\n<li>Poor reading ability</li>\n<li>General tension</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>How can I detect and treat my Hyperopia?</strong>\n\nSight testing and common vision screenings can be ineffective in assigning the right diagnosis for hyperopia. Our common association with letters, allows us to assign the correct letter on the eye chart by shape association with no relation to amount of focus on the letter itself. The best way to detect your farsightedness is through a comprehensive optometric examination at one of our 4 convenient office locations to receive a full screening for Hyperopia and any other eye related ailments. Once we have assessed your issues and detected Hyperopia in your ocular system, there are multiple options for treatment depending on your particular case. If case where the farsightedness is mild, your eyes may be able to naturally correct themselves without the use of corrective lenses, but you may need glasses for reading and computer use. If the case is severe, you may be prescribed glasses for full time use and perhaps open options for corrective laser surgery. Although it may take some time to adjust to wearing glasses, farsightedness will not significantly affect your lifestyle as long as you are receiving proper treatment. Attending Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle Developmental Optometry and Vision Therapy Services for a regular check up every six months is necessary to keep vision at the highest levels of performance.

If an inflammation of the conjunctiva occurs, you may have contracted Conjunctivitis or what commonly referred to as ‘Pink Eye’. If you are suffering from red eyes, inflamed inner lids, watery eyes, blurred vision or a sandy feeling in the eyes, it is possible that you have a form of Conjunctivitis. There are three types of conjunctivitis, and they each present differently: \n\n<strong>Infectious Conjunctivitis:</strong>\n\nThis form is what most people commonly refer to as Pink Eye and is caused by contagious bacteria or a virus finding its way into the ocular system. The symptoms of this form of the ailment can create a puss like or watery discharge around the eyelids. This type of Conjunctivitis is commonly seen in children but can be contracted by people of any age. \nTo treat infectious ''pink eye'' you will need to acquire an antibiotic eye drop or ointment from your eye doctor. If the form of Conjunctivitis that you have contracted is viral and not bacterial, it will not be subdued by antibiotics and must be fought off by your immune system. Fighting viral Conjunctivitis can be assisted with artificial tears or antihistamine eye drops. \n\n<strong>Allergic Conjunctivitis:</strong>\n\nYour own body''s allergies to outer elements such as cosmetics, fabrics, animals or pollens can bring a bout of Allergic Conjunctivitis. If you are suffering from an allergic contraction of Conjunctivitis, you will notice a stringy white mucous present in the eye. \n\nSince this form of eye inflammation is related to allergies, it can sometimes be treated with over the counter antihistamines or any other medications pertinent to your personal allergies and the seasons. For a home remedy you can place a face towel that is soaked in ice-cold water over closed eyes, this should bring comfort from symptoms and itching. There is no cure to ocular symptoms from seasonal allergies, however prescription medications can be considered for severe cases. \n\n<strong>Chemical Conjunctivitis:</strong>\n\nIf you are frequently in contact with pollution, chlorine in swimming pools and/or noxious fumes then it is possible that you could have contracted Chemical Conjunctivitis. This form of inflammation also creates itchy, red eyes and can be very detrimental to your eye health. \n\nA simple treatment for chemical related inflammation in the eye is to simply remove the eye from the cause; so stop swimming in chlorinated water or wear protective eye gear when coming into contact with noxious gases. There are over the counter eye drops and other prescriptions that can help relieve irritation caused by the ailment; however it is most important to protect your eyes with special gear when swimming or being around pollutants. \n\nOnce you are aware that you have contracted this infection it is important to be cautious of how much you interact with others. Some strains of Conjunctivitis are highly infectious and sufferers should be careful to not share pillows, towels, cosmetics or eye drops with others. Small children should not attend school or day care and be kept completely away from swimming pools until they seek treatment from an Optometrist. \n\nConjunctivitis of certain forms can be very harmful to your eyes and in turn affect your vision, it is important to seek help from an Optometrist immediately after experiencing symptoms in order to diagnose the correct treatment related to the strain that you have contracted. Drs. Tod Davis and Amy Carlyle of Developmental Optometry and Vision Therapy Services will provide you with phenomenal care and treatment for any issues with ocular infection and vision impairments.
